# AGENT 3 SEARCH LOG - ANGOLA (AGO)
# Zero-Transmission Validation - Gap Confirmation and Historical Verification
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP TO BE UPDATED]
# Target: Minimum 4 batches (100 queries), stop when 3 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield

# ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION STRATEGY:
# - Confirm absence of cholera during gap periods (2000-2005, 2019-2022, 2023-2024)
# - Validate surveillance system functionality during cholera-free periods
# - Cross-reference with neighboring countries and regional patterns
# - Document evidence of active disease control or natural absence
# - Distinguish between no disease vs. no reporting

# AGENT 3 BATCH TRACKING:
# Yield = (Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows / 25 queries per batch) Ã— 100%
# Stopping Criteria: 3 consecutive batches <5% yield after minimum 4 batches

# BATCH 1 (Queries 1-25): COMPLETED
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP]
# Queries: 25 zero-transmission validation searches targeting gap periods 2000-2005, 2019-2022, 2023-2024
# Data Extracted: 0 new rows added to cholera_data.csv
# Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 successful queries / 25 total queries)
# Key Findings:
# - 2000-2005 decade absence: WHO sources confirm cholera re-emerged in 2006 following decade-long absence (1997-2006)
# - 2019-2022 zero transmission: Confirmed by ECDC surveillance data, Angola cholera-free 2018-2025
# - 2023-2024 surveillance: ECDC reports "as of 2 May 2024, no cases were reported" - validated absence
# - Post-war surveillance: 2002 war end led to health system reconstruction, cholera absence until 2006
# - WHO surveillance framework: Member states encouraged to report "zero reporting" for absence of cases
# - Surveillance system functioning: WHO trained 120+ workers, enhanced data management during absence periods
# - Cross-border validation: DRC linkage documented (1973, 1977, 2006), Zambia preparedness (2019-2022), Namibia 2006-2007 import from Angola
# - WASH improvements context: 44% lack safe water, 55% lack sanitation - ongoing vulnerability despite absence periods
# - Environmental factors: Drought-cholera correlation documented, war movement restrictions contributed to absence
# - Regional SADC surveillance: Angola chairs SADC cholera summits, coordinates regional surveillance
# - Laboratory surveillance: WHO supports National Laboratory, strengthens diagnostic capacity
# - Vaccination campaigns: Post-absence prevention strategies, 2025 outbreak prompted 2M vaccination campaign
# - EWARS implementation: 80% outbreaks have EWARS, median 29-day detection time for Angola
# Quality: 90% Level 1 sources (WHO, ECDC, academic literature), 10% Level 2 sources (Relief organizations)
# Sources: No new sources added (validation of existing surveillance documentation)
# Status: Yield at 0% below 5% threshold, continuing to Batch 2

# BATCH 2 (Queries 26-50): COMPLETED
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP]
# Queries: 25 surveillance validation methodology searches targeting system quality, verification methods, and capacity assessment
# Data Extracted: 0 new rows added to cholera_data.csv
# Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 successful queries / 25 total queries)
# Key Findings:
# - Surveillance quality indicators: Angola 29-day median detection time vs 2-day median (regional), indicating slower detection capacity
# - Passive surveillance: 2019-2022 zero reporting validated by WHO surveillance systems, gaps in underreporting identified
# - Active surveillance: Community health workers (CHWs) trained 120+ by WHO, rapid response teams (13 Bengo, 17 national)
# - Laboratory surveillance: WHO supports National Laboratory, RDT+culture+PCR protocols, 69% confirmation rate (2006)
# - Regional surveillance networks: SADC coordination confirmed, Angola chairs extraordinary summits on cholera
# - Cross-border surveillance: DRC (2000-2018 IDSR data), Zambia preparedness (2019-2022), Namibia validation systems
# - WHO AFRO assessments: JEE 2019/2023 evaluations, IHR capacity improvements documented
# - Health information systems: 2008 war-damaged (60% facilities destroyed), defective systems documented
# - Notification systems: WHO Member State "zero reporting" encouraged, absence surveillance protocols
# - Surveillance gaps post-war: 2002-2006 reconstruction period, limited surveillance capacity
# - Training programs: WHO 120+ workers trained, 20+ data management specialists, capacity building focus
# - Performance indicators: Angola weak seasonality patterns, CFR 3.9% highlights detection gaps
# - Outbreak preparedness: Reinforced surveillance 2019-2022, preparedness measures for neighboring outbreaks
# - Detection sensitivity: Limited sentinel sites documented, passive surveillance limitations acknowledged
# - Community engagement: 1,470+ volunteers trained, house-to-house surveillance, social mobilization
# - Digital systems: WHO Berlin Hub collaboration, georeferencing tools, data management enhancement
# - Field investigations: Rapid deployment protocols, 24-hour response guidelines, multidisciplinary teams
# - IDSR integration: 2002 WHO African region adoption, Angola challenges with 29-day detection lag
# - Case definitions: WHO standards evolution, surveillance unit protocols, RDT+laboratory confirmation
# - Verification methods: Laboratory culture+PCR toxigenic confirmation, outbreak triggers, contact tracing
# Quality: 85% Level 1 sources (WHO, ECDC, academic), 15% Level 2 sources (Relief organizations)
# Sources: No new sources added (validation of surveillance methodology documentation)
# Status: Yield at 0% below 5% threshold, 2 consecutive low yields (0%, 0%), minimum 4 batches not reached
# STATUS: CONTINUING TO BATCH 3
