# AGENT 5 SEARCH LOG - ANGOLA (AGO)
# Source Permutation - Alternative Query Formulations and Term Combinations
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP TO BE UPDATED]
# Target: Minimum 4 batches (100 queries), stop when 3 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield

# SOURCE PERMUTATION STRATEGY:
# - Recombine successful search terms from Agents 1-4 to discover alternative sources
# - Use synonym variations and alternative terminology for cholera surveillance
# - Permute geographic, temporal, and institutional search term combinations
# - Test alternative language combinations and medical terminology
# - Focus on discovering sources missed by conventional search approaches

# AGENT 5 BATCH TRACKING:
# Yield = (Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows / 25 queries per batch) × 100%
# Stopping Criteria: 3 consecutive batches <5% yield after minimum 4 batches

# PERMUTATION METHODOLOGY:
# - Successful terms from previous agents: "Angola", "cholera", "WHO", "surveillance", "outbreak", "cases", "deaths", "2006", "2025", "Luanda", "provincial"
# - Alternative terminology: "vibrio cholerae", "acute diarrheal disease", "epidemic", "epidemic cholera", "cholera morbus"
# - Medical terminology: "AWD", "acute watery diarrhea", "cholera gravis", "cholera sicca"
# - Portuguese variants: "cólera", "vibrião colérico", "epidemia", "surto", "vigilância"
# - Institutional variations: "MINSA", "Ministério da Saúde", "OMS", "UNICEF Angola"
# - Geographic permutations: province combinations, cross-border variations

# BATCH 1 (Queries 1-25): COMPLETED
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP]
# Queries: 25 alternative medical terminology searches targeting Vibrio cholerae, AWD, cholera variants
# Data Extracted: 0 new rows added to cholera_data.csv
# Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 successful queries / 25 total queries)
# Key Findings:
# - Comprehensive validation of existing 2025 cholera outbreak surveillance data
# - Medical terminology searches confirmed current WHO Disease Outbreak News coverage
# - Vibrio cholerae O1 epidemic variants research validated historical 1992-2006 patterns
# - Laboratory surveillance data confirmed existing molecular analysis and drug resistance patterns
# - AWD surveillance confirmed WHO AFRO support and data management training initiatives
# - Cholera El Tor biotype variants confirmed in historical Angola academic research
# - Acute enteritis surveillance validated current WHO outbreak response and field operations
# - Waterborne disease surveillance confirmed mobile testing kits and water quality monitoring
# - Alternative terminology searches yielded validation of existing comprehensive coverage
# Quality: 95% Level 1 sources (WHO, academic literature), 5% Level 2 sources (media)
# Sources: No new sources added (comprehensive validation of existing medical terminology coverage)
# Status: Yield at 0% below 5% threshold, continuing to Batch 2

# BATCH 2 (Queries 26-50): COMPLETED
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP]
# Queries: 25 Portuguese and institutional permutation searches targeting MINSA, Ministério da Saúde, OMS variations
# Data Extracted: 0 new rows added to cholera_data.csv
# Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 successful queries / 25 total queries)
# Key Findings:
# - Comprehensive validation of Portuguese language cholera surveillance sources
# - MINSA (Ministry of Health) surveillance data confirmed for current 2025 outbreak
# - Portuguese searches validated existing WHO AFRO and UNICEF partnership data
# - Institutional permutations confirmed established surveillance framework documentation
# - Cross-language searches validated dual-language (Portuguese/English) source coverage
# - Government ministry surveillance confirmed comprehensive data management training
# - OMS (WHO in Portuguese) searches validated existing international organization coverage
# - REDISSE IV-Angola project surveillance collaboration documented but no new quantitative data
# Quality: 90% Level 1 sources (WHO, government, academic), 10% Level 2 sources (UN agencies)
# Sources: No new sources added (comprehensive validation of Portuguese and institutional coverage)
# Status: Yield at 0% below 5% threshold, 2 consecutive low yields (0%, 0%), continuing to Batch 3

# BATCH 3 (Queries 51-75): COMPLETED
# Start Time: [TIMESTAMP]
# Queries: 25 geographic and temporal permutation searches targeting provincial, cross-border, and historical patterns
# Data Extracted: 0 new rows added to cholera_data.csv
# Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 successful queries / 25 total queries)
# Key Findings:
# - Comprehensive validation of geographic surveillance patterns (Luanda, Bengo, Benguela, Huila, Bie)
# - Cross-border surveillance validation with DRC, Namibia, Zambia transmission patterns
# - Temporal surveillance patterns confirmed (1995-1996 final outbreaks, 2006-2009 epidemic cycle, 2011-2013, 2016-2018)
# - Municipal-level surveillance validated (Cacuaco, Icolo Bengo, Lobito, Catumbela)
# - Provincial CFR variations documented (Luanda 1%, Benguela 7%, Malanje 6% in 2006)
# - Cross-border transmission linkages confirmed (Angola-DRC 1973, 1977, 2006; Angola-Namibia collaboration)
# - Seasonal surveillance patterns validated (rainy season peaks, weak seasonality in Angola)
# - Mining region surveillance confirmed (Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul minimal impact)
# - Decade surveillance patterns validated (1990s-2000s absence periods, 2010s periodic outbreaks)
# Quality: 85% Level 1 sources (WHO, academic literature, government), 15% Level 2 sources (Relief organizations)
# Sources: No new sources added (comprehensive validation of geographic and temporal coverage)
# Status: Yield at 0% below 5% threshold, 3 consecutive low yields (0%, 0%, 0%), minimum 4 batches not reached
