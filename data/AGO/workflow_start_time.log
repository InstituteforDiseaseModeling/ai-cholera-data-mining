6-AGENT PROGRESSIVE SEARCH WORKFLOW - ANGOLA (AGO)
==================================================

WORKFLOW START: 2025-07-20 15:26:51 UTC

TARGET: Complete 6-agent progressive search for cholera surveillance data enhancement
COUNTRY: Angola (AGO)
PROTOCOL: Ultra Deep Search with progressive agent methodology

AGENT SEQUENCE:

2. Agent 2: Geographic expansion (<5% yield stop)
3. Agent 3: Temporal completion (<5% yield stop)
4. Agent 4: Obscure source expansion (<5% yield stop)
5. Agent 5: Source permutation (<1% yield stop)
6. Agent 6: Final validation and audit
