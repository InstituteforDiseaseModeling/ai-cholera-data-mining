=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Benin (BEN)
Start Time: 2025-07-23 17:10:00
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ===
Focus: Provincial, district, and municipal level cholera data discovery
Target: Administrative breakdown of existing national-level outbreaks and new geographic-specific data
Strategy: Department-specific searches, commune-level investigations, sub-national administrative units
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries) - MAXIMUM 100 queries (5 batches)

Current Benin Administrative Structure:
- 12 Departments: Alibori, Atacora, Atlantique, Borgou, Collines, Donga, Littoral, Mono, Oueme, Plateau, Zou, Couffo
- Major communes: Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Parakou, Djougou, Bohicon, Kandi, Ouidah, Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa

Agent 1 Results: 0% data observation yield across 5 batches (100 queries) - existing dataset appears comprehensive
Geographic Strategy: Focus on sub-departmental granularity and commune-level specificity for existing outbreaks
