ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION OBJECTIVES:
- Systematic validation of cholera-free periods with surveillance confirmation
- Documentation of ALL validated absence periods as data observations in cholera_data.csv
- Cross-border validation against neighboring country outbreak patterns
- Historical gap analysis between documented outbreaks
- Surveillance system capacity validation during absence periods

IDENTIFIED GAP PERIODS FOR VALIDATION:
- Historical gaps: 2000-2002, 2004-2007 (pre-2003 outbreak and post-2003 to pre-2008)
- Mid-decade gaps: 2017-2020 (between 2016 and 2021 outbreaks)
- Departmental absence periods: Zou, Couffo departments not in recent affected list
- Annual validation: 2019, 2020 (minimal activity years per surveillance data)
