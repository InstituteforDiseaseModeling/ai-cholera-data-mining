=== AGENT 5 SEARCH LOG ===

SOURCE PERMUTATION OBJECTIVES:
- Systematic variation of successful query patterns from Agents 1-4
- Cross-validation and verification of previously identified sources
- Alternative keyword combinations and search engine permutations
- Multi-language query variations and regional terminology exploration
- Temporal approach permutations (decade-specific, seasonal, epidemic cycles)
- Source cross-referencing and citation network following
- Systematic gap-filling through query strategy permutation

SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS FROM AGENTS 1-4 FOR PERMUTATION:
- WHO Disease Outbreak News variations
- Academic literature searches (PubMed, HAL, Persée)
- Regional surveillance (WAHO, WHO AFRO, ECOWAS)
- French colonial medical archives approaches
- Geographic administrative level permutations
- Cross-border transmission analysis variations
- Traditional/ethnomedicine source exploration
- Institutional repository mining strategies

PERMUTATION STRATEGIES FOR BENIN:
- Alternative spellings: Bénin, Dahomey, République du Bénin
- Language variations: français, English, português (colonial legacy)
- Administrative variations: départements, provinces, communes, districts
- Temporal permutations: 1970s-2025, colonial period, post-independence
- Source type combinations: academic + institutional + governmental
- Cross-border permutations: Nigeria-Benin, Togo-Benin, regional synchrony
