MOSAIC AI Cholera Data Collection - Agent 1 Search Log
Country: Burkina Faso (BFA)
Agent 1 Start Time: 2025-01-27 21:38:23 UTC

GAP-TARGETED SEARCH FOCUS:
- Priority periods: Pre-2013 historical data and Post-2023 recent data
- Missing years: 2000-2009 and earlier historical periods
- Current coverage: 100% for 2013-2023 (complete surveillance)
- Search priority: LOW but comprehensive coverage required

BATCH-BASED EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
- Minimum 5 batches (100 queries) baseline requirement
- Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <8% data observation yield
- Data observation yield = queries adding NEW rows to cholera_data.csv
- Parallel processing: 20 queries per batch
