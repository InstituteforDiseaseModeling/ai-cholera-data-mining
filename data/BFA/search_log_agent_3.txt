BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION RESULTS:
✓ 0 new data observations added to cholera_data.csv
✓ 0 new sources added to metadata.csv
✓ Data observation yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 4% threshold)

EVIDENCE EVALUATION:
- CRITICAL FINDING: French academic source states "Depuis lors, aucun cas de choléra n'a été notifié par les services de santé du pays" (Since then, no cases of cholera have been reported by country health services) - referring to post-2005 period
- WHO surveillance data: Zero reported cases for 2006 and 2008 confirmed
- IDSR system: Fully operational 2006-2011, cost analysis demonstrates functioning surveillance
- Regional context: Burkina Faso notably absent from West African cholera outbreak patterns 2006-2011

- Cross-validation: Absence since 2011 consistently reported across multiple sources
- Surveillance capacity: FETP support, HDSS systems, YF surveillance validation 2007-2008

VALIDATION STATUS:
- Strong evidence for 2006-2011 cholera absence period
- French academic source provides definitive post-2005 absence confirmation
- IDSR surveillance systems operational and validated during target period
- WHO surveillance data supports zero transmission for available years (2006, 2008)
- Regional patterns confirm Burkina Faso absence from major outbreak cycles

CUMULATIVE RESULTS AFTER 2 BATCHES:
- Total queries: 40
- Total new sources: 0
- Total data observations: 0
- Batch yields: 0%, 0% (2 consecutive batches below 4% threshold)

AGENT 3 STOPPING CRITERIA ACHIEVED: 2 consecutive batches <4% yield
