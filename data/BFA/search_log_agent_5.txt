AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION - SEARCH LOG
==========================================
Start Time: 2025-01-27 17:00:00
Country: Burkina Faso (BFA)
Agent Objective: Alternative search formulations and source combinations to discover remaining cholera surveillance data

SOURCE PERMUTATION PARAMETERS:
- Focus: Creative query permutations, alternative terminology, missed source combinations
- Target: Discover cholera data through unexplored search vectors and term combinations
- Stopping criteria: 2 consecutive batches <4% data observation yield (minimum 2 batches)
- SUCCESS CRITERIA: Discovery of ANY new quantitative cholera data through alternative approaches

BASELINE FROM AGENTS 1-4:
- Agent 1 discoveries: 9 data observations, 8 sources
- Agent 2 discoveries: 1 data observation (Pissy municipal), 1 source  
- Agent 3 discoveries: 2 zero-transmission observations, 2 sources
- Agent 4 discoveries: 0 data observations, 0 sources
- Total current: 12 data observations, 11 sources
- Coverage gaps: 1975-2000 historical, pre-1971 historical, 2022-2025 recent surveillance

SOURCE PERMUTATION TARGETS:
- Alternative terminology: "diarrhoea", "acute watery diarrhoea", "gastroenteritis", "cholera-like illness"
- Creative combinations: Ministry + district + year combinations not previously tried
- Missed institutional approaches: French colonial archives, missionary records, bilateral cooperation
- Source type permutations: Government statistics + academic + humanitarian report combinations
- Geographic permutations: Administrative divisions + outbreak + surveillance combinations
- Temporal permutations: Season + year + outbreak + response combinations
