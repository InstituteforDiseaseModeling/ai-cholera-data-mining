Start Time: 2025-01-27 17:15:00
Country: Burkina Faso (BFA)
Agent Objective: Comprehensive quality assurance, data validation, and final source verification

QUALITY AUDIT PARAMETERS:
- Focus: Data validation, source verification, cross-reference checking, quality control
- Target: Ensure data integrity and completeness of all collected observations
- Maximum: 4 batches (80 queries maximum)
- CRITICAL: Validate all existing data observations and sources for final submission

BASELINE ASSESSMENT FROM AGENTS 1-5:
- Agent 1 discoveries: 9 data observations, 8 sources (baseline establishment)
- Agent 2 discoveries: 1 data observation, 1 source (Pissy municipal breakdown)
- Agent 3 discoveries: 2 zero-transmission observations, 2 sources (absence periods)
- Agent 4 discoveries: 0 data observations, 0 sources (obscure sources)
- Agent 5 discoveries: 0 data observations, 0 sources (source permutation)
- Total current: 12 data observations, 11 sources

QUALITY AUDIT TARGETS:
- Source verification: Confirm all 11 metadata sources remain accessible and accurate
- Data validation: Cross-check key quantitative data (cases, deaths, CFRs) with additional sources
- Zero-transmission validation: Additional confirmation of 2006-2011 and 2013-2020 absence periods
- Historical data verification: Validate 1971, 1973-1974 historical data with additional sources
- Recent data confirmation: Verify 2021 imported cases and 2012 deaths data
- Regional consistency: Cross-check with neighboring countries' patterns

CRITICAL DATA VALIDATION PRIORITIES:
1. Historical data (1971-1974): 1,760 cases/501 deaths (1971), 1,114 cases/241 deaths (1973), 632 cases/66 deaths (1974)
2. 2001 outbreak: 314 cases/6 deaths, Ourgaye district - WHO validation
3. 2005 epidemic: 1,050 suspected/121 confirmed cases - PMC study validation
4. 2012 deaths: 7 cholera deaths - Knoema statistical validation
5. 2021 cases: 3 imported cases, 0 deaths - cross-border validation
6. Zero-transmission periods: 2006-2011 and 2013-2020 absence documentation

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Source accessibility: 100% of URLs must be verified as working or archived
- Data consistency: All quantitative values must be cross-validated where possible
- Temporal logic: All date sequences must be epidemiologically plausible
- Geographic accuracy: All location codes must be verified and standardized
- Reliability assessment: All confidence weights must be justified and documented
