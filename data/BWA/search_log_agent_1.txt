  - Running total: 2 observations from 40 queries (5% overall)

=== AGENT 1: BATCH 3 START ===
[00:40:37] Starting Batch 3 (41-60/200 queries)
[00:42:22] Batch 3 searches completed (60/60)
[00:42:45] Batch 3 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (PMC diarrheal disease study: no specific cholera data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Running total: 2 observations from 60 queries (3.3% overall)

=== AGENT 1: BATCH 4 START ===
[00:43:15] Starting Batch 4 (61-80/200 queries)
[00:45:32] Batch 4 searches completed (80/80)
[00:45:55] Batch 4 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive historical/regional searches found no additional quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Running total: 2 observations from 80 queries (2.5% overall)
  - Key findings: Confirmed BWA's low cholera burden, 2018 NHL negative testing validation, regional preparedness activities

=== AGENT 1: BATCH 5 START ===
[00:46:20] Starting Batch 5 (81-100/200 queries)
[00:48:45] Batch 5 searches completed (100/100)
[00:49:15] Batch 5 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive coverage of remaining search domains found no additional quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Running total: 2 observations from 100 queries (2% overall)
  - Key findings: Confirmed BWA's systematic surveillance infrastructure, climate-health vulnerabilities, regional partnerships

=== AGENT 1: COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
[00:49:30] STOPPING CRITERIA EVALUATION:
✓ Minimum 5 batches completed (100 queries)
✓ Consecutive low-yield batches: 3, 4, 5 all achieved 0% yield (<10% threshold)
✓ Exceeds 2-consecutive requirement for stopping
✓ Systematic coverage of priority domains completed

AGENT 1 STATUS: COMPLETED
- Total queries: 100/200 (50% of maximum, stopped due to yield criteria)
- Total data observations: 2 (2018 zero-transmission, 2023 zero-transmission validation)
- Overall yield: 2% (below 10% threshold for 3 consecutive batches)
- Comprehensive baseline established for BWA cholera surveillance data
