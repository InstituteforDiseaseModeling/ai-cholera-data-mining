=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Botswana (BWA)
Agent: 2 - Geographic Expansion
Start Time: 2025-07-23 00:49:45

=== GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION MANDATE ===
Focus: Provincial and district-level cholera data discovery
Search Strategy: Administrative subdivision systematic coverage
Target Areas: All 10 districts plus major urban centers
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)
Maximum Queries: 100 (5 batches)

=== BOTSWANA ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS ===
Districts: Central, Ghanzi, Kgalagadi, Kgatleng, Kweneng, North East, North West, South East, Southern, Chobe
Major Urban Areas: Gaborone, Francistown, Molepolole, Maun, Serowe, Selibe Phikwe, Kanye, Mochudi, Mahalapye, Lobatse

=== AGENT 2: BATCH 1 START ===
[00:50:00] Starting Batch 1 (1-20/100 queries)
Focus: District-level cholera searches across administrative divisions
[00:53:30] Batch 1 searches completed (20/20)
[00:53:50] Batch 1 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive district-level coverage found no additional quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: Confirmed 2023 Francistown suspected case (tested negative), 2009 water contamination events, absence of cholera across all 10 districts
  - Geographic coverage: All districts systematically searched, no active transmission found

=== AGENT 2: BATCH 2 START ===
[00:54:10] Starting Batch 2 (21-40/100 queries)
Focus: Sub-district level and cross-border cholera transmission patterns
[00:58:45] Batch 2 searches completed (40/40)
[00:59:10] Batch 2 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive sub-district and border coverage found no additional quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: 2009 Tonota water contamination context, comprehensive border crossing surveillance, village-level absence confirmation
  - Geographic coverage: All major villages across all 10 districts systematically searched

=== AGENT 2: COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
[00:59:25] STOPPING CRITERIA EVALUATION:
✓ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries)
✓ Consecutive low-yield batches: 1, 2 both achieved 0% yield (<5% threshold)
✓ Meets 2-consecutive requirement for stopping
✓ Comprehensive geographic expansion coverage completed

AGENT 2 STATUS: COMPLETED
- Total queries: 40/100 (40% of maximum, stopped due to yield criteria)
- Total data observations: 0 (comprehensive geographic search found no additional data)
- Overall yield: 0% (below 5% threshold for 2 consecutive batches)
- Geographic expansion confirmed BWA's low cholera burden at all administrative levels
