=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Botswana (BWA)
Agent: 4 - Obscure Source Expansion
Start Time: 2025-07-23 01:19:15

=== OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION MANDATE ===
Focus: Specialized databases, archives, and alternative sources for cholera data discovery
Search Strategy: Systematic exploration of obscure sources and gray literature
Target: Comprehensive coverage of specialized databases, institutional repositories, archives
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)
Maximum Queries: 100 (5 batches)

=== CURRENT DATA BASELINE ===
Existing data: 4 observations, 5 sources (baseline data + 2 zero-transmission validations)
Previous agent findings: Strong evidence of BWA's low cholera burden but limited quantitative data
Agent 3 conclusion: Zero-transmission validation supported by multiple evidence sources

=== PRIORITY OBSCURE SOURCE TARGETS ===
1. Specialized health databases and archives
2. Academic institutional repositories and thesis collections
3. Historical colonial and missionary archives
4. Regional organization databases (SADC, AU, etc.)
5. International humanitarian organization archives
6. Government archival collections and gray literature
7. Specialized epidemiological databases
8. Alternative surveillance sources and technical reports
9. Institutional memory sources and expert networks
10. Cross-border surveillance archives

=== AGENT 4: BATCH 1 START ===
[01:19:30] Starting Batch 1 (1-20/100 queries)
Focus: Specialized databases and academic repositories
[01:35:15] Batch 1 searches completed (20/20)
[01:35:30] Batch 1 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive specialized database searches found extensive framework but no new quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: UBRISA academic repository identified, historical archives located, regional surveillance networks documented
  - Specialized resources: Multiple professional databases and surveillance networks identified but no BWA-specific quantitative data discovered

=== AGENT 4: BATCH 2 START ===
[01:35:45] Starting Batch 2 (21-40/100 queries)
Focus: Gray literature, technical reports, and alternative surveillance sources
[01:55:00] Batch 2 searches completed (40/40)
[01:55:15] Batch 2 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive gray literature and technical assistance searches found extensive frameworks but no new quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: Multiple development partners and technical assistance organizations identified with BWA presence, professional frameworks documented
  - Gray literature coverage: Extensive technical assistance and professional networks identified but no BWA-specific quantitative cholera data discovered

=== AGENT 4: COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
[01:55:30] STOPPING CRITERIA EVALUATION:
✓ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries)
✓ Consecutive low-yield batches: 1, 2 both achieved 0% yield (<5% threshold)
✓ Meets 2-consecutive requirement for stopping
✓ Comprehensive obscure source expansion coverage completed

AGENT 4 STATUS: COMPLETED
- Total queries: 40/100 (40% of maximum, stopped due to yield criteria)
- Total data observations: 0 (comprehensive obscure source searches found extensive professional networks but no quantitative data)
- Overall yield: 0% (below 5% threshold for 2 consecutive batches)
- Obscure source expansion confirmed BWA's integration in professional networks but yielded no additional quantitative cholera data
