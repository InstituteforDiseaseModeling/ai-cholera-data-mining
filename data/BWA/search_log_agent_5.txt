=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Botswana (BWA)
Agent: 5 - Source Permutation
Start Time: 2025-07-23 01:56:00

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION MANDATE ===
Focus: Source permutation and cross-validation approaches
Search Strategy: Alternative query permutations, validation techniques, cross-referencing methods
Target: Cross-validation of existing data through alternative search methodologies
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)
Maximum Queries: 100 (5 batches)

=== CURRENT DATA BASELINE ===
Existing data: 4 observations, 5 sources
Agent 1 findings: 2 zero-transmission validations (2018, 2023)
Agent 2-4 conclusion: 0% yield across all batches, comprehensive coverage completed
Key data points: 23 cases (2000-2023), 55 cases March 2009, 2 zero-transmission periods

=== PRIORITY PERMUTATION TARGETS ===
1. Alternative query formulations of existing data points
2. Cross-validation of 2009 outbreak through different search approaches
3. Reverse chronological search strategies
4. Synonym and terminology permutation approaches
5. Cross-referencing methodologies with regional data
6. Alternative database access approaches for existing sources
7. Temporal permutation searches (different date combinations)
8. Geographic permutation approaches (alternative location terms)
9. Source chain permutation and backward referencing
10. Methodological cross-validation approaches

=== AGENT 5: BATCH 1 START ===
[01:56:15] Starting Batch 1 (1-20/100 queries)
Focus: Alternative query permutations and cross-validation approaches for existing data
[02:02:30] Batch 1 searches completed (20/20)
[02:02:45] Batch 1 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive source permutation searches found extensive validation evidence but no new quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: Cross-validation of existing 2009 outbreak data, regional surveillance framework validation, comprehensive laboratory capacity confirmation
  - Alternative search validation: Multiple permutation approaches confirmed BWA's low cholera burden through different methodological lenses

=== AGENT 5: BATCH 2 START ===
[02:03:00] Starting Batch 2 (21-40/100 queries)
Focus: Advanced validation methodologies and comprehensive cross-referencing approaches
[02:10:15] Batch 2 searches completed (40/40)
[02:10:30] Batch 2 Results:
  - Queries executed: 20/20
  - New data observations: 0 (comprehensive advanced validation searches found extensive supporting evidence but no new quantitative data)
  - Data observation yield: 0%
  - Files unchanged: cholera_data.csv (4 total rows), metadata.csv (5 total sources)
  - Key findings: Regional surveillance framework validation, climate vulnerability assessments, comprehensive laboratory capacity confirmation, IHR compliance documentation
  - Advanced validation: Multiple methodological approaches confirmed BWA's exceptionally low cholera burden with extensive supportive infrastructure evidence

=== AGENT 5: COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
[02:10:45] STOPPING CRITERIA EVALUATION:
✓ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries)
✓ Consecutive low-yield batches: 1, 2 both achieved 0% yield (<5% threshold)
✓ Meets 2-consecutive requirement for stopping
✓ Comprehensive source permutation coverage completed

AGENT 5 STATUS: COMPLETED
- Total queries: 40/100 (40% of maximum, stopped due to yield criteria)
- Total data observations: 0 (comprehensive source permutation searches found extensive validation evidence but no new quantitative data)
- Overall yield: 0% (below 5% threshold for 2 consecutive batches)
- Source permutation confirmed BWA's low cholera burden through multiple validation methodologies
