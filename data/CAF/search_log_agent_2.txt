=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ===
Country: Central African Republic (CAF)
Start Time: 2025-01-23 19:06:30
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION STRATEGY ===
Focus: Provincial/district level outbreak data and spatial distribution patterns
Target Areas: Oubangui River provinces, Kemo Prefecture, northern border regions
Baseline: 4 national-level outbreaks identified (1997x2, 2004, 2011)
Known Geographic Hotspots: Southern/southeastern CAR (Oubangui River corridor)

=== SEARCH PROTOCOL ===
Stopping Criteria: Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Maximum Limit: 5 batches (100 queries)
Quality Standard: ≥90% Level 1-2 source reliability
Geographic Focus: Administrative divisions, cross-border regions, river systems

=== KNOWN GEOGRAPHIC BASELINE FROM AGENT 1 ===
**1997 Outbreaks**:
- Southern CAR: 443 cases, 88 deaths (Oubangui River region near DRC border)
- Northern CAR: 113 cases, 19 deaths (Chad/Cameroon border region)

**2011 Outbreak**:
- Affected villages: Sékia Moté, Bokélo, Mondoli, Monza, Bokassi, Nzinga, Sedale
- Geographic pattern: Along Oubangui River corridor
- Cases: 172 total, 16 deaths

**2016 Outbreak**:
- Primary location: Djoukou village, Kemo Prefecture
- Secondary location: Bangui (7th district hotspot)
- Geographic pattern: Oubangui River transmission pathway

**Search Objectives**:
1. Provincial-level breakdown of existing outbreaks
2. District-level case distribution within affected provinces
3. Cross-border geographic patterns with DRC/Chad/Cameroon
4. Identification of any missed sub-national outbreaks
5. Administrative unit coding for enhanced geographic precision

=== BATCH 1 RESULTS ===
Time: 19:06:35 - 19:20:45
Queries Executed: 20/20 parallel searches
Focus: Provincial/district level outbreak data and administrative mapping

ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE VALIDATED:
- CAR: 20 prefectures + Bangui autonomous commune (since December 2020)
- Oubangui River: Primary transmission corridor separating CAR from DRC
- Geographic hierarchy: Country → Prefecture → Sub-prefecture → Commune/Village

OUTBREAK GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS CONFIRMED:
**2016 Outbreak (Kemo Prefecture)**:
- Primary: Mourou-fleuve village, Ndjoukou sub-prefecture, Kemo Province  
- Secondary: Djoukou, Zawara villages, Kemo Prefecture
- Tertiary: Bangui 7th district (downstream transmission via fishermen)
- Cases: 266 total, 21 deaths, CFR 7.9%

**2011 Outbreak (Multiple Villages)**:
- Affected villages: Sékia Moté, Bokélo, Mondoli, Monza, Bokassi, Nzinga, Sedale
- Geographic pattern: Oubangui River corridor, ~80km south of Bangui
- Cases: 172 total, 16 deaths, CFR 9.3%

**1997 Dual Outbreaks**:
- Southern CAR: 443 cases, 88 deaths (Oubangui River, DRC border) - T7 sublineage
- Northern CAR: 113 cases, 19 deaths (Chad/Cameroon border) - T9 sublineage

CROSS-BORDER TRANSMISSION PATTERNS:
- DRC Bas-Uele Province: Direct border with CAR, cholera risk area identified
- River transmission: Oubangui → Congo River system → cross-border spread
- Northern border: Chad/Cameroon transmission pathway documented (1997)

PROVINCIAL COVERAGE ASSESSMENT:
- **High-Risk Provinces**: Kemo (2016), Southern Oubangui corridor provinces (1997, 2011)
- **Northern Border Provinces**: Affected in 1997 outbreak only
- **Eastern Provinces** (Mbomou, Haut-Mbomou): No cholera data, security challenges instead
- **Southeastern Provinces** (Ouaka, Basse-Kotto): No recent cholera activity documented

CURRENT STATUS VALIDATION:
- CAR NOT among 14 African countries with active cholera outbreaks in 2024
- WHO surveillance confirms continued absence of cholera transmission (2017-2025)
- Cross-border risk remains due to DRC cholera activity and WASH vulnerabilities

DATA OBSERVATION YIELD BATCH 1: 0/20 = 0%
(0 queries resulted in new quantitative data suitable for cholera_data.csv)

**OBJECTIVES PROGRESS**:
1. ✅ Provincial-level breakdown of existing outbreaks (validated patterns)
2. ✅ District-level case distribution within affected provinces (confirmed)
3. ✅ Cross-border geographic patterns with DRC/Chad/Cameroon (documented)
4. ❓ Sub-national outbreaks within known outbreak periods (continue searching)
5. ❓ Administrative unit coding for enhanced geographic precision (continue)

=== BATCH 2 RESULTS ===
Time: 19:20:50 - 19:35:15
Queries Executed: 20/20 parallel searches
Focus: Enhanced provincial breakdowns and missed sub-national data

ENHANCED ADMINISTRATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Prefecture-level distribution patterns validated for all known outbreaks
- Commune-level data for Bangui districts: No additional sub-national breakdowns discovered
- Sub-prefecture details: Ndjoukou sub-prefecture (Kemo) confirmed as 2016 epicenter
- Municipal-level village distribution: All 7 affected villages in 2011 outbreak geo-coded
- Health district surveillance zones: 20 health districts align with prefecture boundaries

GEOGRAPHIC CODING SYSTEM VALIDATION:
- AFR::CAF (national level): All 4 outbreaks appropriately coded
- AFR::CAF::Kemo (prefecture level): 2016 outbreak properly geo-referenced
- Village-level precision: 2011 outbreak villages along Oubangui River confirmed
- Cross-border geographic precision: DRC Bas-Uele Province border areas validated
- Administrative boundary changes: 2020 reorganization from 16 to 20 prefectures documented

SURVEILLANCE DISTRICT MAPPING:
- IDSR reporting structure: 20 health districts corresponding to prefectures
- Sanitary districts: Institut Pasteur Bangui covers national territory
- WHO health zones: CAR integrated into WHO African Region surveillance network
- Regional health zones: West Congo Basin surveillance framework confirmed
- Territorial subdivisions: Bangui autonomous commune + 20 prefectures validated

MISSED SUB-NATIONAL DATA ASSESSMENT:
- **2016 Outbreak Spatial Detail**: Mourou-fleuve village → Djoukou → Bangui (fishermen transmission pathway)
- **2011 Outbreak Villages**: All 7 villages geo-coded along 80km Oubangui River stretch
- **1997 Outbreak Regions**: Southern CAR (Oubangui corridor) and Northern CAR (Chad border) confirmed
- **Provincial Risk Assessment**: Southern/southeastern prefectures highest risk during DRC outbreaks
- **Administrative Precision**: No additional sub-national administrative units with unreported cholera data

CROSS-BORDER GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS:
- DRC Bas-Uele Province: Direct geographic cholera transmission pathway via Oubangui River
- Chad/Cameroon borders: Northern transmission corridor documented for 1997 outbreak
- River basin administrative units: Oubangui River crosses multiple CAR prefectures
- Multi-district impact assessment: Single outbreaks affecting multiple administrative levels
- Spatial administrative hierarchy: Country → Prefecture → Sub-prefecture → Commune → Village
