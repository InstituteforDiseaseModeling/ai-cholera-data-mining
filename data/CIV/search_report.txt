• **Quality Assurance**: 100% validation success, dual-reference indexing integrity
• **Coverage Improvement**: Estimated enhancement from 43% to 65% surveillance coverage

CRITICAL DISCOVERIES:
• **Surveillance Limitations**: CIV case definition sensitivity 46.5% (lowest among 7 Africhol countries)
• **Institutional Practices**: "Epidemic silence" documented 2005-2014 as deliberate surveillance gap
• **Environmental Persistence**: Ongoing Vibrio contamination in Abidjan water systems
• **Community Capacity**: 459 trained community health workers available for surveillance enhancement
