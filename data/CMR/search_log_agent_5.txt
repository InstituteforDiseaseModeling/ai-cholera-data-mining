AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION - SEARCH LOG
=============================================
Country: Cameroon (CMR)
Focus: Systematic permutation of search terms and source combinations
Target: Alternative query structures, cross-combinations not covered in Agents 1-4
Started: 2025-01-22

OBJECTIVES:
- Systematic permutation of successful search terms from previous agents
- Cross-combination of geographic and temporal terms
- Alternative source entry points and query structures
- Explore permutations of institutional + geographic + temporal combinations
- Target unfound combinations that may yield additional data

STOPPING CRITERIA:
- Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stop when: 2 consecutive batches <4% data observation yield
- Maximum: 240 queries (12 batches)

PERMUTATION STRATEGY:
- Geographic × Temporal × Institutional permutations
- Successful term combinations from Agents 1-4 in new structures
- Alternative entry points to previously accessed sources
- Cross-reference validation through permuted queries

CURRENT STATUS: Starting Agent 5 execution

Data Extraction Results:
- 0 NEW rows added to cholera_data.csv
- Extensive validation and contextual information gathered
- Confirmed cross-border transmission patterns for Lake Chad basin
- Validated surveillance system improvements in 2010s decade
- Documented seasonal transmission patterns by climate zone

DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% ✗ (Below 4% threshold)

Key Findings:
- Source permutation methodology validated existing data through alternative query structures
- Cross-border transmission patterns well-documented in Lake Chad basin endemic reservoir
- Seasonal patterns vary by climate subzone (northern rainy season vs southern year-round)
- Surveillance system improvements documented but quantitative data already captured in previous agents
- No new quantitative cholera case data discovered through permuted search combinations
