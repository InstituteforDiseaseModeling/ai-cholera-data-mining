- Quality audit focused, not data discovery focused
- Final agent in 6-agent workflow sequence

QUALITY AUDIT FOCUS AREAS:
- Cross-reference validation of major outbreaks across multiple sources
- Temporal consistency check across historical periods
- Geographic coverage assessment across all 10 regions
- Validation of zero-transmission periods
- Source reliability verification
- Data format and dual-reference indexing integrity

CURRENT STATUS: Starting Agent 6 execution

- ✓ Cross-border transmission patterns validated through genomic studies
- ✓ Zero-transmission periods validated through epidemiological analysis
- ✓ Humanitarian response coordination validated through operational reports

DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Quality audit focus, validation complete)

Critical Validation Outcomes:
1. Data Integrity: All major data points validated through peer-reviewed sources
2. Source Reliability: Multiple independent confirmation for key outbreaks
3. Temporal Consistency: Historical wave patterns confirmed
4. Geographic Accuracy: Regional distribution patterns validated
