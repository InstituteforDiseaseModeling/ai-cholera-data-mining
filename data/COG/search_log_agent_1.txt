23. Query 29: Provincial data Brazzaville Pointe-Noire → 2011-2012 outbreak data
24. Query 35: Treatment centers CTC CTU → Infrastructure and capacity data

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 4/20 = 20% (Above 10% threshold)

=== BATCH 3 EXECUTION (Queries 41-60) ===
Time: 11:12:00 - 11:18:00
Focus: Zero-transmission validation, academic research, molecular epidemiology, refugee crisis data

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (2 queries yielded new data rows):
41. Query 44: Congo refugee 1990s humanitarian emergency → 1994 Goma cholera crisis 50,000+ deaths
42. Query 58: International assistance funding → Funding mechanisms and coordination data

BATCH 3 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 2/20 = 10% (At 10% threshold - continue)

=== BATCH 4 EXECUTION (Queries 61-80) ===
Time: 11:18:00 - 11:25:00
Focus: Historical data 2000-2012, recent surveillance 2024-2025, zero-transmission validation, cross-border intelligence

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (0 queries yielded new data rows):
- Multiple searches conducted for historical periods 2000-2012 but no specific quantitative Republic of Congo data found

- French language searches conducted but no specific quantitative data found
- Climate, WASH, vaccination, economic studies found but no Republic of Congo-specific quantitative data

BATCH 4 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Below 10% threshold - continue to minimum 5 batches)

=== BATCH 5 EXECUTION (Queries 81-100) ===  
Time: 11:25:00 - 11:32:00
Focus: Historical archives, ministry reports, academic research, humanitarian operations, surveillance systems
