=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Republic of Congo (COG)
Start Time: 2025-01-24 11:33:00
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED - Geographic Expansion

=== GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION STRATEGY ===
Focus: Provincial-level, district-level, and cross-border regional intelligence
Target: Administrative subdivision data for Republic of Congo
Primary Geographic Divisions: Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Niari, Kouilou, Pool, Bouenza, Plateaux, Cuvette, Sangha, Likouala

=== AGENT 2 BATCH-BASED EXECUTION LOG ===
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Data Observation Yield = (Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows / 20 queries per batch) × 100%

=== BATCH 1 EXECUTION (Queries 101-120) ===
Time: 11:33:00 - 11:40:00
Focus: Provincial-level data (Niari, Pointe-Noire, Pool, Bouenza, Plateaux, Cuvette, Sangha, Likouala, Lékoumou), cross-border intelligence (DRC, Cameroon, Gabon, CAR, Angola)

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (0 queries yielded new data rows):
- Provincial searches conducted for all major Republic of Congo departments
- 2023 triple outbreak data found but already captured by Agent 1
- 2007 Pointe-Noire outbreak data found but already captured by Agent 1  
- 2011-2012 national outbreak data found but already captured by Agent 1
- Cross-border intelligence gathered but no new quantitative Republic of Congo data
- Regional coordination information found but no specific Republic of Congo case numbers
- Geographic expansion searches mostly yielded data already in cholera_data.csv

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Below 5% threshold - continue to minimum 2 batches)

=== BATCH 2 EXECUTION (Queries 121-140) ===
Time: 11:40:00 - 11:47:00  
Focus: District-level searches (Mouyondzi, Makélékélé, Tié-Tié, Mfouati, Oyo, Ewo, Ouesso, Impfondo, Kindamba, Djambala, Sibiti), municipal/commune level data, administrative breakdowns

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (0 queries yielded new data rows):
- District-level searches conducted across all major Republic of Congo administrative divisions
- 2023 triple outbreak data found at district level but already captured by Agent 1
- 2007 Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire data found but already captured by Agent 1
- 2011-2012 national outbreak references found but already captured by Agent 1
- Municipal, commune, and arrondissement level searches conducted but no new quantitative data
- Administrative breakdown searches mostly yielded DRC data or general information
- Community health worker and surveillance system information found but no new Republic of Congo case numbers

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 2 COMPLETION SUMMARY ===
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT MET: 2 batches completed (40 queries total)
STOPPING CRITERIA ACHIEVED: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (Batch 1: 0%, Batch 2: 0%)

GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ASSESSMENT: Agent 1 appears to have captured the major cholera outbreaks at national and provincial levels. District and municipal level searches did not reveal additional quantitative data beyond what was already collected.

Agent 2 geographic expansion completed successfully at 11:47:00
