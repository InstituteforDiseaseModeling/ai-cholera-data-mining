=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Republic of Congo (COG)
Start Time: 2025-01-24 12:08:00
Agent 4 Status: INITIALIZED - Obscure source expansion & beyond-suggested-sources

=== OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION STRATEGY ===
Focus: Beyond-suggested-sources exploration, unconventional source discovery, deep institutional diving
Target: Alternative data sources not covered by priority_sources.txt, archived materials, specialized databases
Primary Objectives:
1. Explore Internet Archive for historical cholera documentation
2. Search specialized medical and epidemiological databases beyond suggested sources
3. Investigate academic institutional repositories and theses
4. Access regional health organization archives and reports
5. Discover unconventional sources (colonial records, missionary archives, historical newspapers)

=== BEYOND-SUGGESTED-SOURCES METHODOLOGY ===
Focus areas for expansion beyond reference/priority_sources.txt:
- Internet Archive Wayback Machine for historical surveillance reports
- National library and archive systems
- University institutional repositories
- Regional African health organization databases
- Historical colonial administrative records
- Missionary medical mission records
- International development organization archives
- Specialized tropical medicine databases

=== AGENT 4 BATCH-BASED EXECUTION LOG ===
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Data Observation Yield = (Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows / 20 queries per batch) × 100%

=== BATCH 1 EXECUTION (Queries 181-200) ===
Time: 12:08:00 - 12:18:00
Focus: Obscure source expansion, Internet Archive searches, institutional repositories, colonial archives

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (0 queries yielded new data rows):
- Internet Archive searches conducted for historical Republic Congo surveillance reports but no specific quantitative data found
- French colonial archives at Brazzaville explored but no quantitative cholera data extracted
- Academic thesis and institutional repositories searched but focused primarily on DRC rather than Republic Congo
- Historical newspaper archives identified (La France de Brazzaville) but no specific cholera quantitative data extracted
- Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine archives explored but colonial expeditions did not yield Republic Congo cholera data
- World Bank and UNESCO archives searched but no specific cholera quantitative data found
- Specialized databases and repositories explored but no new Republic Congo cholera observations discovered

OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ASSESSMENT:
- Internet Archive yielded extensive historical cholera documentation but mostly from other regions
- Colonial archives in Brazzaville contain French Equatorial Africa materials but specific cholera data not accessible through web search
- Academic repositories contain substantial DRC cholera research but limited Republic Congo-specific quantitative data
- Specialized institutional archives identified but would require direct contact for access to cholera-specific materials
- Historical newspapers and colonial medical bulletins found but specific Republic Congo cholera data not immediately extractable

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Below 5% threshold - continue to minimum 2 batches)

=== BATCH 2 EXECUTION (Queries 201-220) ===
Time: 12:18:00 - 12:28:00
Focus: Additional obscure source expansion, institutional repositories, specialized archives, beyond-suggested-sources

SUCCESSFUL DATA EXTRACTIONS (0 queries yielded new data rows):
- Archives Nationales du Congo Brazzaville: Historical colonial archives AEF period identified but no specific cholera quantitative data
- Catholic mission archives (Congrégation Saint-Esprit): Historical medical records 1888-1930 documented diseases but no cholera specifics
- French Equatorial Africa colonial medical records: Extensive Rita Headrick research identified but no specific Republic Congo cholera data
- Université Marien Ngouabi thesis repository: Medical research infrastructure confirmed but no cholera studies for Republic Congo
- Centre de Recherches Médicales: No specific results found for historical epidemiological studies
- La Semaine Africaine newspaper archives: Historical archives from 1952+ available but no cholera outbreak coverage identified
- FONCAM (Fondation Congolaise pour l'Action Médicale): No search results found
- ORSTOM/IRD tropical medicine research: Historical research documented but limited Republic Congo cholera focus
- Peace Corps volunteer health records: Regional presence confirmed but no cholera outbreak documentation
- Institut Pasteur: Regional outpost via Bangui identified but no specific Brazzaville laboratory cholera surveillance
- Médecins du Monde historical missions: DRC cholera work documented but no specific Republic Congo Pointe-Noire missions
- Action Contre la Faim WASH interventions: DRC focused activities but no Republic Congo specific cholera interventions
- Première Urgence historical archives: DRC operations confirmed but no Republic Congo cholera emergency response archives
- Hôpital Général de Brazzaville: CHU-B historical context documented but no accessible patient cholera records
- CHU historical outbreak documentation: Current surveillance confirmed but no historical cholera outbreak archives
- Programme National de Lutte surveillance: DRC programs well-documented but no Republic Congo specific archives
- Direction Générale de la Santé bulletins: Current epidemiological bulletins found but no historical cholera archives
- RAEOT network: No specific network found, related AFENET networks active in DRC but not Republic Congo focused
- WAHO regional surveillance: West African focus, Congo not ECOWAS member, limited regional cholera monitoring
- Société Congolaise de Médecine archives: No search results found for medical society historical archives

OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ASSESSMENT BATCH 2:
- Extensive institutional archives identified but most lack digitized cholera-specific quantitative data
- Colonial period medical archives (AEF) exist but require physical consultation for cholera data extraction
- University medical research infrastructure present but limited Republic Congo cholera research focus
- Newspaper archives available but cholera outbreak coverage not digitally accessible
- International NGO presence documented but primarily DRC focused for cholera responses
- Hospital and clinical archives exist but patient records not publicly accessible
- Government surveillance systems active but historical cholera bulletins not archived online
- Regional networks primarily serve other countries (DRC focus for Central Africa, West Africa focus for WAHO)

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (Below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 4 COMPLETION SUMMARY ===
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT MET: 2 batches completed (40 queries total)
STOPPING CRITERIA ACHIEVED: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (Batch 1: 0%, Batch 2: 0%)

OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION RESULTS:
- 40 total queries executed across Internet Archive, colonial archives, academic repositories, institutional databases
- Extensive archival infrastructure identified but limited digitized cholera quantitative data available
- Most promising sources (colonial AEF archives, university repositories, newspaper archives) require direct institutional contact
- Republic Congo appears to have limited historical cholera research compared to neighboring DRC
- Current surveillance infrastructure active but historical archives not systematically digitized
