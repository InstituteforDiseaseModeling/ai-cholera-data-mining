=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Republic of Congo (COG)
Start Time: 2025-01-24 12:28:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED - Source permutation & adjacent data mining

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION & ADJACENT DATA MINING STRATEGY ===
Focus: Alternative search approaches, source recombination, creative query formulation, adjacent data mining
Target: Novel search combinations, alternative terminology, source chain permutations, adjacent contextual data
Primary Objectives:
1. Explore alternative terminology and linguistic variations
2. Recombine successful sources from previous agents with new approaches
3. Mine adjacent epidemiological and contextual data that may contain cholera references
4. Apply creative permutations of search terms and source combinations
5. Investigate temporal and geographic adjacencies for cholera data discovery

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION METHODOLOGY ===
Strategic approaches for discovering missed data through alternative search combinations:
- Alternative disease terminology (acute watery diarrhea, gastroenteritis, epidemic diarrhea)
- Geographic permutations (former names, colonial designations, regional variations)
- Temporal permutations (seasonal patterns, epidemic waves, pandemic periods)
- Institutional permutations (predecessor organizations, merged entities, subsidiary programs)
- Source chain permutations (reference following, citation networks, report version tracking)
- Adjacent data mining (WASH assessments, nutrition surveys, emergency response evaluations)

=== AGENT 5 BATCH-BASED EXECUTION LOG ===
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Data Observation Yield = (Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows / 20 queries per batch) × 100%

=== BATCH 1 EXECUTION (Queries 221-240) ===
Time: 12:28:00 - 12:38:00

- Geographic permutations (Middle Congo, AEF, departments) provided context but no additional quantitative data
- Temporal permutations (2005-2009, 2010-2012) confirmed 2007 and 2011-2012 outbreaks already captured
- Adjacent data mining (WASH, nutrition, preparedness) provided epidemiological context but no cholera case data
- Source chain permutations revealed surveillance system limitations and data gaps
- Alternative language searches confirmed same outbreak information in French
- Cross-border analysis provided transmission patterns but no new Republic Congo data
- Institutional permutations (national laboratory, WHO AFRO) confirmed surveillance capabilities but no new data
