=== AGENT 1 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Eritrea (ERI)
Start Time: 2025-07-23 18:00:04
Agent 1 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 1: BASELINE ESTABLISHMENT ===
Objective: Execute foundational 8-phase search protocol with batch-based stopping criteria
Requirements: Minimum 5 batches (100 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <10% data observation yield
Target: Eritrea has 0% surveillance coverage - extremely high priority for comprehensive searching

BATCH 1 STARTING - 20 parallel searches targeting TIER 1 priority sources
Focus: WHO, government ministry (moh.gov.er), CDC, surveillance agencies
Time: 18:02:00

BATCH 1 COMPLETED - 20 parallel searches executed
Results Summary:
- WHO apps/afro/who.int: No current Eritrea cholera data, country not in recent outbreak lists
- moh.gov.er: Domain not accessible/no results
- CDC: Eritrea not listed in countries with active cholera transmission
- Africa CDC: Eritrea not in 16 AU states reporting cholera cases
- Regional exclusion: Multiple studies exclude Eritrea due to limited surveillance data
- Cross-border: Ethiopia border areas identified as cholera hotspots

KEY QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS:
1. 2005-2008: 120 cholera cases (WHO Global Health Atlas via Johns Hopkins)
2. 2000-2023: 120 cases, 9 deaths, 2 outbreaks total (lowest burden in WHO Africa)
3. 2019: Mortality rate 17.62 per 100,000 (males: 20.23, females: 15.82)

- Government archives: moh.gov.er domain consistently inaccessible 
- Alternative engines: DuckDuckGo, Bing yielded similar results to Google searches
- Historical context: Confirmed 1993 Horn of Africa cholera re-emergence pattern

KEY QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS:
1. September 2016: 22 cholera cases in Gash-Barka region (Ethiopian refugee camps)
2. Regional pattern: Ethiopia-Eritrea border areas identified as cholera transmission corridors
3. Quarantine measures: Gash-Barka region isolated during September 2016 outbreak

SOURCES WITH POTENTIAL DATA BUT ACCESS ISSUES:
- Geeska Afrika archives (domain inaccessible but content found in metadata)
- Asmarino.com historical reports (server errors)
- Eritrean Ministry of Health bulletins (domain consistently down)

BATCH 3 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 1 out of 20 queries (5%) - BELOW THRESHOLD
Time: 19:15:00

CONSECUTIVE LOW YIELD COUNT: 2 (batches 2 and 3 both <10%)
STATUS: MINIMUM 5 BATCHES REQUIRED - CONTINUING TO BATCH 4

DATA ADDED TO CSV FILES:
- Entry 3: 22 cases September 2016 Gash-Barka region (Ethiopian refugees)

BATCH 4 STARTING - 20 parallel searches targeting historical and linguistic approaches
Focus: Colonial archives, Portuguese/Arabic sources, pre-digital records, missionary reports

- UN/UNICEF archives: Found regional cholera response documentation but no Eritrea-specific campaigns
- IDSR implementation: Confirmed Eritrea adapted WHO IDSR guidelines in May 2022
- WASH risk assessment: Confirmed Eritrea in Cluster 3 (highest cholera risk due to poor WASH services)

KEY CONTEXTUAL FINDINGS:
1. Systematic exclusion: Major cholera burden studies exclude Eritrea due to limited data availability
2. High mortality rates: 2019 cholera mortality among highest in Africa despite low case numbers
3. WASH vulnerabilities: 76% open defecation, only 16% basic sanitation access
4. Surveillance integration: Cholera not fully integrated into IDSR system historically
5. Regional patterns: Cross-border transmission documented with Ethiopia and Sudan
