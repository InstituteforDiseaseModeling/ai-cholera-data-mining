Focus: Archive searches + Specialized databases + Alternative terminology
Target: Discover missed sources through unconventional search methods
Parameters: Conditional 2-5 batches, stop at 2 consecutive <5% yield, MAXIMUM 100 queries
Start Time: 2025-07-23 14:53:15

ETHIOPIA OBSCURE SOURCE TARGETS:
- Internet Archive searches for broken/moved links
- Specialized databases (ProMED, HealthMap, Disease outbreaks)
- Alternative terminology (AWD, acute watery diarrhea, fangal)
- Colonial/historical archives and missionary records
- Local language sources (Amharic cholera terminology)
- University institutional repositories
- Conference proceedings and grey literature
- Alternative spellings and transliterations
- Specialized humanitarian databases beyond ReliefWeb

=== BATCH 1: ALTERNATIVE TERMINOLOGY & ARCHIVE SEARCHES (1/20 - 20/20) ===
Focus: AWD terminology + Internet Archive + Alternative spellings
Batch Start: 14:53:45
[14:57:52] BATCH 1 COMPLETE - Obscure source expansion and alternative terminology searches completed

BATCH 1 FINDINGS - OBSCURE SOURCE DISCOVERIES:
✅ ALTERNATIVE TERMINOLOGY VALIDATED

KEY DISCOVERIES:
1. **Historical Term "Fangal"**: Validated Amharic term for cholera from 1634 onwards
2. **Internet Archive Resources**: "Africa in the time of cholera" by Echenberg covering Ethiopia 1821-1894
3. **Ethiopian Academic Repositories**: AAU-ETD, NADRE, multiple university repositories identified
4. **Laboratory Records**: Extensive V. cholerae isolation studies from Addis Ababa, Oromia, Amhara
5. **IFRC Humanitarian Database**: DREF operation records from 2019 cholera response
6. **Specialized Databases**: ProMED archives, HealthMap references, GOARN response records
7. **Alternative Spellings**: "Diarrhoea" vs "diarrhea" usage patterns in official documents
8. **Grey Literature**: SSHAP briefs, government elimination plans, OCHA situation reports

BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION:
- Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows: 0/20
- Data observation yield: 0%
- Status: BELOW 5% threshold - valuable source discovery but no quantitative data extracted
- Metadata sources identified: 5+ new potential sources discovered
- Quality discoveries: Historical terminology, archive resources, repository access
- Cumulative Agent 4: 0 new data observations (focused on source discovery vs data extraction)

=== BATCH 2: SPECIALIZED INSTITUTIONAL & HISTORICAL ARCHIVES (21/40 - 40/40) ===
Focus: Colonial archives + University thesis extraction + Specialized medical databases
Batch Start: 14:58:30
[15:02:15] BATCH 2 COMPLETE - Specialized archives and institutional database searches completed

BATCH 2 FINDINGS - HISTORICAL ARCHIVE DISCOVERIES:
✅ EXTENSIVE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION IDENTIFIED

KEY ARCHIVE DISCOVERIES:
1. **British Foreign Office Records**: FO 1 & FO 403 series with Abyssinia correspondence 1846-1910
2. **Walter Plowden 1856 Cholera Report**: British consul documented major epidemic with specific details
3. **Ethiopian Academic Repositories**: AAU-ETD, NADRE institutional access confirmed
4. **Missionary Medical Archives**: Wheaton College Hockman & Scheel papers with medical records
5. **EPHI Data Repository**: NDMC archives with 500+ datasets and 469 metadata entries
6. **Laboratory Isolation Records**: Extensive V. cholerae culture data from multiple regions
7. **Historical Epidemic Documentation**: Pankhurst's work referencing 1831-1906 outbreaks  
8. **Government Ministry Archives**: Pre-2011 surveillance system development records

HISTORICAL VALIDATION DISCOVERIES:
- 1634 "Fangal" outbreak confirmed in Ethiopian chronicles
- Five major epidemics documented: 1831-1836, 1856, 1866-1867, 1889-1892, 1906
- 1856 epidemic: British Consul Plowden reported army "disorganized" by cholera
- Laboratory records: 415 samples processed, V. cholerae isolation protocols documented
- Missionary medical missions: Robert Hockman (1906-1935) medical service documented

BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION:
- Queries resulting in NEW cholera_data.csv rows: 0/20
- Data observation yield: 0%
- Status: BELOW 5% threshold - historical validation but no quantitative case data extracted
- Archive sources identified: 8+ major historical collections discovered
- Quality discoveries: Extensive historical documentation and institutional access confirmed
- Cumulative Agent 4: 0 new data observations (2 consecutive batches <5% yield)
