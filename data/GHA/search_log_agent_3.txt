=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Ghana (GHA)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 17:35:30
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 3: ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION AND SYSTEMATIC ABSENCE DOCUMENTATION ===
Objective: Systematically validate and document ALL cholera-free periods with mandatory cholera_data.csv entries
Gap Analysis: 93.4% coverage (LOW priority), Focus on validating absence periods and surveillance gaps
Search Strategy: Target zero-transmission validation, surveillance system documentation, absence confirmation
Stopping Criteria: Min 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Document ALL validated cholera-free periods as data observations in cholera_data.csv

Current Status from Previous Agents:
- Agent 1: 13 observations added (1999-2025 span, national and regional data)
- Agent 2: 16 observations added (rows 14-29, district-level expansion)
- Total: 29 observations spanning 1999-2025

Zero-Transmission Targets:
- 2000-2009: Historical surveillance gaps requiring absence validation
- 2006-2011: Gap periods between documented outbreaks
- 2017-2023: Recent surveillance gaps requiring validation
- Inter-outbreak periods: Validate cholera-free periods between documented outbreaks

CSV Files Status:
- metadata.csv: 41 sources (Agent 1: 16, Agent 2: 25 additional)
- cholera_data.csv: 29 observations (comprehensive outbreak data 1999-2025)
