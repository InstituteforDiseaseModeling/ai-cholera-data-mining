=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Ghana (GHA)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 19:45:00
Agent 4 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 4: OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION BEYOND SUGGESTED DOMAINS ===
Objective: Systematically search beyond the 486 priority sources for rare, specialized, and obscure cholera data
Gap Analysis: 93.4% coverage (LOW priority), Focus on discovering unique sources outside standard frameworks
Search Strategy: Target obscure academic databases, regional archives, specialized platforms beyond priority_sources.txt
Stopping Criteria: Min 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield, MAX 5 batches (100 queries)

Current Status from Previous Agents:
- Agent 1: 13 observations added (systematic priority source coverage)
- Agent 2: 16 observations added (geographic expansion across 16 regions)
- Agent 3: 6 observations added (zero-transmission validation)
- Total: 35 observations spanning 1999-2025

Obscure Source Targets (Beyond 486 Priority Sources):
- Specialized regional archives and institutional repositories
- Non-standard academic databases and thesis repositories
- Local government archives and municipal health records
- Historical colonial health records and missionary archives
- Specialized international organization reports
- Regional development bank health assessments
- Professional association archives and conference proceedings
- Local media archives and community health newsletters

CSV Files Status:
- metadata.csv: 50 sources (Agents 1-3: comprehensive priority source coverage)
- cholera_data.csv: 35 observations (comprehensive surveillance data 1999-2025)
