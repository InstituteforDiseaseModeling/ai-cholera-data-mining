=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Ghana (GHA)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 21:15:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION AND ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Objective: Use alternative search terms, permutations, and adjacent data mining techniques to discover missed information
Gap Analysis: 93.4% coverage (LOW priority), Focus on alternative search approaches and source permutation strategies
Search Strategy: Alternative terminology, adjacent location mining, temporal permutations, cross-referencing existing sources
Stopping Criteria: Min 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield, MAX 5 batches (100 queries)

Current Status from Previous Agents:
- Agent 1: 13 observations added (systematic priority source coverage)
- Agent 2: 16 observations added (geographic expansion across 16 regions)
- Agent 3: 6 observations added (zero-transmission validation)
- Agent 4: 0 observations added (obscure source expansion)
- Total: 35 observations spanning 1999-2025

Source Permutation Targets:
- Alternative terminology: "diarrheal disease," "acute watery diarrhea," "gastroenteritis," "AWD"
- Adjacent geographic mining: Border regions, refugee camps, mining sites, coastal communities
- Temporal permutations: Different date ranges, seasonal patterns, epidemic cycles
- Cross-referencing: Citation networks, related outbreaks, co-occurring diseases
- Language variations: Local language terms, colonial terminology, vernacular expressions
- Institutional permutations: Different departments, agencies, organizational levels

CSV Files Status:
- metadata.csv: 50 sources (Agents 1-4: comprehensive source coverage completed)
- cholera_data.csv: 35 observations (comprehensive surveillance data 1999-2025)
