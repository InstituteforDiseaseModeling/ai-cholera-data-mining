✓ URL accessibility: No broken links detected in sample validation

=== QUANTITATIVE DATA VALIDATION ===
✓ Case range validation: sCh values range 0-28,975 (epidemiologically plausible)
✓ CFR range validation: 0.0%-33.3% (majority within 0.5-5% acceptable range)
✓ Death count validation: All deaths ≤ sCh (mathematical consistency)
✓ Confidence weights: Appropriate distribution 0.7-1.0 based on source reliability
