=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Guinea (GIN)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 13:27:15
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION & SUBNATIONAL DATA MINING ===
Objective: Enhanced geographic granularity and subnational cholera data collection
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries) before stopping criteria apply
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Data observation yield = queries that add NEW rows to cholera_data.csv / 20 queries per batch

=== BASELINE STATUS FROM AGENT 1 ===
Current Data: 10 observations in cholera_data.csv
Current Sources: 10 sources in metadata.csv
Geographic Coverage: National (AFR::GIN), Conakry (AFR::GIN::Conakry), N'zerekore (AFR::GIN::N'zerekore)
Temporal Coverage: 1970-2025
Priority Areas: Prefecture-level data, district-level breakdowns, municipal/commune data

=== AGENT 2 STRATEGIC FOCUS ===
Target Administrative Levels:
- Prefecture-level outbreaks and surveillance data
- Sub-prefecture and district-level cholera reports
- Municipal and commune-level case data
- Health district surveillance breakdowns
- Urban vs rural cholera patterns

Priority Prefectures (from previous research):
- Conakry (capital, major epidemic center)
- Kindia (secondary continental extension)
- Boke (coastal, cross-border with Guinea-Bissau)
- Forecariah (2012 outbreak origin area)
- Coyah, Dubreka (Conakry epidemiological entity)

Search Strategy:
- Prefecture health directorate reports
- District health center surveillance
- Municipal health service data
- Sub-national outbreak investigations
- Health district epidemiological bulletins

=== BATCH 1/20 QUERIES - PREFECTURE-LEVEL DATA MINING ===
Focus: Prefecture health directorates + Sub-national surveillance + District breakdown data
Start Time: 2025-07-24 13:27:30
End Time: 2025-07-24 13:35:45

BATCH 1 RESULTS SUMMARY:
✅ Enhanced Prefecture-Level Understanding:
- Guinea administrative structure: 33 prefectures + Conakry capital
- DHIS2 surveillance system covers all 38 districts since 2018
- Prefecture health directorates (directions préfectorales de la santé) role documented
- Sub-prefecture administrative breakdown identified (Coyah: 4 sub-prefectures)
- Health district structure documented (Koundara: 7 health areas)
- Urban vs rural health posts infrastructure mapped
- Municipality-level surveillance capacity established (Conakry surveillance network)
- Regional laboratory support: Labe and Kankan with cholera testing capacity

✅ Prefecture-Specific Context:
- Kindia: High-risk urban location, continental extension epicenter
- Boke: Coastal, cross-border with Guinea-Bissau, 2012 outbreak affected
- Forecariah: 2012 outbreak vaccination campaign site
- Coyah-Dubreka-Forecariah: Conakry epidemiological entity
- Gueckedou-Macenta: Forest region, health infrastructure documented
- Labe: Regional laboratory with cholera testing capacity
- Multiple prefectures: Surveillance framework established but limited public data

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions (0% yield)
Status: Below Agent 2 threshold (5%) - first batch, minimum 2 batches required

=== BATCH 2/20 QUERIES - HEALTH DISTRICT & COMMUNE-LEVEL DATA ===
Focus: Health district surveillance reports + Commune/municipal data + Treatment center statistics
Start Time: 2025-07-24 13:35:50
End Time: 2025-07-24 13:48:30

BATCH 2 RESULTS SUMMARY:
✅ Enhanced Health District Understanding:
- Conakry municipal breakdown: Kaloum, Dixinn, Matam, Matoto, Ratoma
- Treatment center infrastructure: Donka hospital, Ratoma health center, Kaporo CTC
- 2012 epidemic municipal attack rates: Kaloum (0.16%) to Matoto/Ratoma (0.31%)
- Ratoma district highest attack rates: 0.72%-1.33% in northern contiguous areas
- Boffa vaccination campaign: 89.4% first dose, 79.8% second dose coverage
- Kaback Island outbreak: >100 cases first month (Forecariah sub-prefecture)
- DHIS2 implementation: All 38 districts with cholera surveillance capacity
- Community health workers: 12,000 trained for surveillance across districts
- Laboratory capacity: Labe and Kankan regional labs with cholera testing
- Health district structure: EOCs established in all 38 districts

✅ Treatment and Surveillance Infrastructure:
- CTCs in Conakry: Donka, Dabompa (Matoto), Kaporo (Ratoma) with MSF support
- DHIS2 case-based surveillance: Individual case forms since 2019
- Africhol surveillance network: Enhanced surveillance in Conakry 2011-2013
- Community-based surveillance: Post-Ebola strengthening with 4,813 CHWs trained
- Case investigation forms: Standardized forms with clinical and laboratory data
- Rural health posts: Three-level reporting (community-prefectural-national)

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions (0% yield)
Status: Below Agent 2 threshold (5%) - second consecutive batch, minimum 2 batches completed

=== AGENT 2 COMPLETION STATUS ===
STOPPING CRITERIA MET:
✅ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries total)
✅ 2 consecutive batches below 5% data observation yield (Batches 1, 2: both 0%)
