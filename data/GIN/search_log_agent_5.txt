=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Guinea (GIN)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 15:10:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION & ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Objective: Systematic permutation of existing sources and exploration of adjacent data sources
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries) before stopping criteria apply
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Data observation yield = queries that add NEW rows to cholera_data.csv / 20 queries per batch
**MAXIMUM: 100 queries (5 batches) - hard limit**

=== BASELINE STATUS FROM AGENTS 1-4 ===
Current Data: 10 observations in cholera_data.csv (from Agent 1)
Current Sources: 10 sources in metadata.csv (from Agent 1)
Agents 2-4: Comprehensive validation completed with 0% data observation yield
Timeline Weeks: 884 AI weeks, 0 WHO weeks, 623 JHU weeks
