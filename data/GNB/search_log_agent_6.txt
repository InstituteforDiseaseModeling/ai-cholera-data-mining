=== AGENT 6 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Guinea-Bissau (GNB)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 16:50:00
Agent 6 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 6 FINAL QUALITY AUDIT AND VALIDATION ===
Objective: Comprehensive quality assessment and final dataset validation
Requirements: Complete quality audit of all data sources and observations
Target: Final dataset validation and comprehensive search report generation
Method: Systematic validation of all previous agent work and final integration

=== GUINEA-BISSAU QUALITY AUDIT SUMMARY ===
Data Collection Complete: 5 agents executed successfully (380 queries total)
Final Dataset Status: 13 observations in cholera_data.csv, 12 sources in metadata.csv
Coverage Enhancement: 1986-2024 comprehensive surveillance with zero-transmission validation
Geographic Detail: National-level plus provincial data (Tombali, Quinara, San_Domingos)

=== FINAL VALIDATION RESULTS ===

DATA INTEGRITY VALIDATION:
✅ Dual-reference indexing system verified (source_index ↔ Index columns)
✅ All cholera_data.csv entries have matching metadata.csv sources
✅ Sequential integer indexing confirmed (1-12) without gaps
✅ All source names exactly match between data and metadata files

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL VALIDATION:
✅ CFR range validation: All values within 0.1-15% plausible range
✅ Temporal logic validation: All TL ≤ TR ≤ reporting_date confirmed
✅ Mathematical consistency: Deaths ≤ sCh validated across all observations
✅ Geographic coding: All AFR::GNB location codes standardized

URL VALIDATION:
✅ 100% of metadata sources have working URLs verified
✅ WHO sources confirmed accessible through official domains
✅ Academic sources validated through PMC, PubMed, ScienceDirect
✅ ReliefWeb sources confirmed through humanitarian databases

QUALITY METRICS:
- Source Reliability: 83% Level 1 sources (WHO/academic), 17% Level 2
- Average Confidence Weight: 0.9 (high confidence)
- Validation Success Rate: 100% sources passed quality control
- Zero-Transmission Validation: 2 periods confirmed via independent sources

=== AGENT 6 COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
