Batch Start Time: 14:10:00
Focus: Health districts, surveillance systems, administrative boundaries, provincial reporting

Batch 2 Queries (14:10:00-14:30:45):

30. Geographic cholera risk - Excluded from major studies due to insufficient data since 2005
31. Health administrative divisions - 716 village councils, 344 neighborhood communities
32. Provincial health surveillance - Surveillance systems strengthened priority, limited specific protocols
33. Geographic health surveillance - Death registration unavailable/unusable due to quality issues
34. Administrative cholera surveillance - WHO level 2-3 administrative surveillance typically
35. Health system administrative - Training/supervision at health district level documented
36. Geographic administrative health - Recent Marburg outbreak demonstrated surveillance in 5 districts across 4 provinces
37. Provincial administrative cholera - No specific provincial cholera surveillance documentation found
38. Administrative cholera surveillance - Cholera-free status since 2005, limited active surveillance needed
