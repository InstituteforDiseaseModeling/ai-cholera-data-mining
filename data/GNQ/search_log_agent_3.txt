- 2016-2020: 5-year validated absence period
- 2021-2025: 5-year validated absence period (ongoing)

BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION:
- Queries executed: 20
- Sources with validation information: Multiple WHO/academic sources validating absence
- Quantitative data extracted (new cholera_data.csv rows): 0 (zero-transmission validation documented separately)
- Data observation yield: 0/20 = 0%

CRITICAL FINDING: Systematic validation of 20-year cholera-free period with multiple sources
MANDATORY ACTION: Document validated absence periods as zero-transmission data observations

CSV files status: Must add validated zero-transmission periods as data observations
