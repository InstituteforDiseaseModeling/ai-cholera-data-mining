Batch 1 Status: COMPLETED - 35% yield (above 10% threshold)
End Time: 15:50:00

=== BATCH 2 - HISTORICAL DEEP DIVE PRE-2016 ===
Start Time: 15:50:00
Target: Extended historical search focusing on 1970s-1990s data
Queries: 20 parallel searches executed
Data Extracted: 1 new observation added to cholera_data.csv (1971 first case)
Sources Found: 3 new sources added to metadata.csv
Data Observation Yield: 5% (1 query resulted in CSV additions)
Key Discoveries:
- 1971: First cholera case in Turkana District, pandemic spread from SE Asia
- Surveillance gap identified: comprehensive data collection began 1997
- Molecular epidemiology: 1975-1984 strains had classical/El Tor characteristics
- Environmental reservoir: Lake Victoria role in transmission 1970s-1980s
- 1992 epidemic mentioned as claiming "thousands" but no specific data
Batch 2 Status: COMPLETED - 5% yield (below 10% threshold - first low batch)
End Time: 16:05:00

=== BATCH 3 - WHO/ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONAL COVERAGE ===
Start Time: 16:05:00
Target: WHO archives, academic databases, institutional reports
Queries: 20 parallel searches executed
Data Extracted: 0 new observations added to cholera_data.csv (molecular studies without quantitative data)
Sources Found: 4 new sources added to metadata.csv (indices 8-11)
Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 queries resulted in CSV additions)
Key Discoveries:
- Molecular epidemiology studies 1975-2017 showing strain evolution
- Environmental reservoir studies Lake Victoria region
- Surveillance improvements 2017-2019 (within existing coverage period)
- Academic sources complement existing surveillance data but no new quantitative observations
Batch 3 Status: COMPLETED - 0% yield (below 10% threshold - second consecutive low batch)
End Time: 16:10:00

=== BATCH 4 - CROSS-BORDER AND REGIONAL PATTERNS ===
Start Time: 16:10:00
Target: Neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda), regional transmission patterns
Queries: 20 parallel searches executed
Data Extracted: 0 new observations added to cholera_data.csv
Sources Found: 3 new sources added to metadata.csv (indices 12-14)
Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 queries resulted in CSV additions)
Key Discoveries:
- Extensive cross-border cholera transmission documentation between Kenya-Ethiopia-Somalia
- Regional surveillance coordination frameworks (WHO AFRO, UNICEF ESARO)
- Cross-border population movement studies and disease surveillance implications
- Lake Victoria regional transmission patterns affecting Kenya-Tanzania-Uganda
- Current 2024-2025 outbreak data (outside target historical period)
- No historical quantitative data discovered for pre-2016 period
Batch 4 Status: COMPLETED - 0% yield (below 10% threshold - third consecutive low batch)
End Time: 16:25:00

=== BATCH 5 - ALTERNATIVE ARCHIVES AND HISTORICAL SOURCES ===
Start Time: 16:25:00
Target: Government archives, colonial records, alternative databases, news archives
Queries: 20 parallel searches executed
Data Extracted: 0 new observations added to cholera_data.csv
Sources Found: 2 new sources added to metadata.csv (indices 15-16)
Data Observation Yield: 0% (0 queries resulted in CSV additions)
Key Discoveries:
- Confirmed 1992 cholera epidemic that "claimed thousands of victims" in Kenya
- Identified potential archive locations (British colonial archives, WHO archives, Kenya National Archives)
- Found academic dissertation on cholera prevention/control but no historical quantitative data
- Located Internet Archive resource on Africa cholera history 1817-2009
- No quantitative surveillance data discovered for 1971-1996 gap period
- Historical sources primarily provide context rather than case/death counts
Batch 5 Status: COMPLETED - 0% yield (below 10% threshold - fourth consecutive low batch)
End Time: 16:40:00

=== AGENT 1 STOPPING CRITERIA ANALYSIS ===
Minimum Baseline Achieved: YES (5 batches completed = 100 queries total)
Consecutive Low Yield Batches: 4 consecutive batches below 10% threshold
- Batch 2: 5% yield (first low batch)
- Batch 3: 0% yield (second consecutive)
- Batch 4: 0% yield (third consecutive)  
- Batch 5: 0% yield (fourth consecutive)

STOPPING CRITERIA MET: Required minimum 5 batches completed + 2 consecutive low batches achieved
AGENT 1 STATUS: COMPLETED - Systematic baseline establishment finished
Total Queries Executed: 100
Total Data Observations Added: 8
Total Sources Added: 16
Final Analysis: Kenya has strong surveillance from 1997 onward, significant gaps 1971-1996 period, confirmed major 1992 epidemic but lacks quantitative data for pre-1997 period despite extensive systematic search.

=== TRANSITION TO AGENT 2 ===
Agent 1 Status: COMPLETED at 16:40:00
Handoff Status: SUCCESS - All systematic baseline requirements met
Next Phase: Agent 2 - Geographic expansion targeting provincial/district breakdowns
