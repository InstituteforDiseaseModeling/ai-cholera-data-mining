BATCH 2 RESULTS:
- Successful queries (with new cholera_data.csv rows): 0/20
- Data observation yield: 0%
- New data observations added: 0
- Sources added to metadata: 0
- Key discoveries: Detailed archival infrastructure mapping, extensive health surveillance frameworks identified, economic impact studies confirmed, multiple research repositories documented
- Alternative source assessment: Comprehensive institutional capacity confirmed but minimal specific cholera data in obscure sources

=== AGENT 4 COMPLETION ASSESSMENT ===
Two consecutive batches with 0% data observation yield achieved (0% and 0%)
Stopping criteria met: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield after minimum 2 batches completed
Total queries executed: 40 queries (2 batches of 20 queries each)
Final assessment: No new cholera data observations identified through obscure source expansion
Key limitation: While extensive alternative source infrastructure exists, specific cholera data in these obscure sources remains extremely limited

=== COMPREHENSIVE ALTERNATIVE SOURCE INFRASTRUCTURE MAPPING ===
Agent 4 successfully documented extensive alternative source capabilities:

**Historical Archives**: Episcopal Church archives (28 cubic feet 1822-1952), IU Holsoe Collection (1828-1911), Presidential Archives, American Colonization Society records
**Academic Repositories**: OATD 1.6M+ theses, ProQuest 5M repository, EBSCO medical databases, A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine
**International Programs**: REDISSE $657M program, World Bank health sector development, UNMIL 11 Level-1 hospitals, UNHCR refugee protocols
**Private Sector Health**: Firestone 80,000 population health system, ArcelorMittal occupational medicine, maritime health documentation
**Surveillance Infrastructure**: eDEWS mobile surveillance, GTFCC 4.3M people monitoring, IHR compliance frameworks
**Research Networks**: P4DP traditional healer studies, anthropological outbreak investigation methods, climate-cholera vulnerability studies

**Strategic Value**: While no new cholera data observations were added, Agent 4 comprehensively mapped Liberia's alternative source landscape, confirming that systematic mainstream searches (Agent 1) captured the available cholera data, with obscure sources containing primarily infrastructure and capacity documentation rather than epidemiological data.
