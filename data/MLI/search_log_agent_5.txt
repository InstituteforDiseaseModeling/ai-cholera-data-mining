=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Mali (MLI)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 17:15:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED
Focus: Source permutation and adjacent data mining
Target: Query combinations, terminology variants, reference following, alternative search approaches
Max Batches: 5 (100 queries maximum)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)

CRITICAL PROTOCOL: Source permutation includes:
1. Combining successful search terms from previous agents
2. Permutations of effective query patterns discovered
3. Alternative terminology and language variants
4. Adjacent source discovery through reference following
5. Cross-validation using different search approaches
6. Citation network exploration and reference chains
7. Institutional source permutations and variations
8. Historical period and geographic permutations

=== AGENT 5 BATCH 1 (QUERIES 1-20) ===
Focus: Successful term combinations + alternative terminology + reference following
Target: Combining effective patterns, French/English variants, institutional permutations
Time: 2025-07-24 17:15:30

KEY FINDINGS BATCH 1:
✓ Comprehensive academic literature review confirmed existing source coverage
✓ Regional outbreak patterns (Mopti, Tombouctou, Gao) consistent with existing data
✓ DHIS2 surveillance system implementation documented for Mali (2016-2024)
✓ Cross-border transmission patterns validated with Niger River corridor
✓ Historical 1984 drought/famine epidemic conditions well-documented
✓ 2020-2021 West Africa outbreak: Mali CFR 38.5% (highest in region)
✓ Seasonal patterns and Niger River flooding relationship confirmed
✓ French colonial medical records identified but no quantitative data accessible
✓ MSF/ICRC humanitarian response documented but no new case numbers

BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION:
Successful queries (produced NEW cholera_data.csv rows): 0/20 = 0%
Sources added to metadata.csv: 0
Data observations added to cholera_data.csv: 0
Status: CONTINUE (minimum 2 batches required, source permutation methodology verified)

=== AGENT 5 BATCH 2 (QUERIES 21-40) ===
Focus: Advanced permutations + technical reports + reference chains + alternative sources
Target: Institutional combinations, technical documentation, alternative time periods, reference following
Time: 2025-07-24 17:45:00

KEY FINDINGS BATCH 2:
✓ Institut Pasteur Dakar 4S surveillance network covers ECOWAS region including Mali
✓ USAID $69.3M health portfolio (2018) covering 75% of Mali population
✓ DHIS2 surveillance system implementation confirmed for Mali (2016-2024)
✓ EU health cooperation €151M (2021-2024) including WASH and health systems
✓ African Union cholera genomics consortium (CholGEN) includes Mali participation
✓ CDC-Mali partnership since 1966 for surveillance and outbreak response
✓ French colonial medical archives documented at Army Tropical Medicine Institute
✓ World Bank-AFDB health sector support documented but no cholera specifics
✓ Peace Corps medical officer structure and UCRC biomedical research capacity confirmed
✓ MEASURE Evaluation DHIS2 technical assistance for epidemiological surveillance

BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION:
Successful queries (produced NEW cholera_data.csv rows): 0/20 = 0%
Sources added to metadata.csv: 0
Data observations added to cholera_data.csv: 0
Status: STOP (2 consecutive batches <5% yield, stopping criteria met)

Agent 5 Summary:
Total batches completed: 2
Total queries executed: 40
Total successful queries: 0/40 = 0% overall yield
Total sources added: 0
Total data observations added: 0
Source permutation: Comprehensive institutional and technical framework mapping completed, no quantitative data discovered
