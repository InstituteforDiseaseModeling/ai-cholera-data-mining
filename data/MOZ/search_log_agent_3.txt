=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Mozambique (MOZ)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 10:48:15
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 3 OBJECTIVES ===
1. Zero-transmission validation and data quality assurance
2. Identify and document validated cholera-free periods
3. Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), maximum 100 queries (5 batches)
4. Stop at 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
5. MANDATORY: Document ALL validated absence periods as data observations in cholera_data.csv

=== CURRENT COVERAGE ANALYSIS ===
Agent 1 + Agent 2 achieved comprehensive coverage (1973-2015 + 2017-2025):
- Total observations: 36 data points across 42 years
- Historical coverage: 1973-2015 (43 years) - excellent baseline
- Recent coverage: 2017-2025 (8 years) - comprehensive current surveillance
- KEY GAP FOR VALIDATION: 2016 potential zero-transmission year (between 2015 cross-border outbreak and 2017 WHO surveillance restart)

=== AGENT 3 STRATEGY ===
Primary Focus: Zero-transmission validation for gap periods and inter-outbreak intervals
Secondary Focus: Cross-validation of existing outbreak data quality
Language Strategy: Portuguese, English, WHO surveillance validation
Geographic Targets: National level absence validation, provincial zero-transmission periods
Administrative Levels: National → Provincial validation

=== ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION TARGETS ===
1. 2016 gap period validation (between 2015 cross-border outbreak and 2017 WHO restart)
2. Inter-outbreak periods within 1973-2015 coverage (validate absence between documented outbreaks)
3. Cross-reference regional patterns (validate Mozambique absence during neighboring country outbreaks)
4. Surveillance system capacity validation (confirm periods with functioning surveillance but zero cases)
