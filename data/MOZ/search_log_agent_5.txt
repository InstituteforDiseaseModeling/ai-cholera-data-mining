=== AGENT 5 STRATEGY ===
Primary Focus: Source permutation, alternative query formulations, and adjacent data mining
Secondary Focus: Citation chain following, reference source exploration, methodology expansion
Language Strategy: Portuguese permutations, alternative English terminology, regional language variants
Geographic Targets: Alternative administrative naming, historical geographic references
Administrative Levels: Alternative terminology for provinces, districts, municipalities

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION TARGETS ===
1. Alternative cholera terminology: cólera, cholera outbreak, epidemic cholera, cholera cases
2. Alternative geographic naming: historical province names, colonial administrative terms
3. Alternative institutional references: ministry variations, health department alternatives
4. Citation chain following: reference lists from existing sources, bibliography mining
5. Adjacent health topics: diarrheal diseases, waterborne diseases, acute watery diarrhea
6. Alternative time period references: seasonal patterns, outbreak cycles, epidemic waves
7. Cross-reference validation: neighboring country data, regional pattern analysis
8. Alternative source formats: press releases, policy documents, technical reports
9. Surveillance terminology variations: epidemiological surveillance, disease monitoring
10. Alternative reporting structures: situational reports, emergency updates, assessment reports
