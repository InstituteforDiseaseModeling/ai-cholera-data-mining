=== AGENT 6 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Mozambique (MOZ)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 12:35:20
Agent 6 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 6 OBJECTIVES ===
1. Final quality audit and comprehensive validation
2. Dataset finalization and integrity verification
3. Source validation and URL verification
4. Creation of brief search_report.txt summarizing key outcomes
5. Internal processing, validation, and quality assurance completion

=== CURRENT DATASET STATUS ===
Previous agents completed comprehensive data collection:
- Agent 1: 28 data observations (1973-2015 historical baseline)
- Agent 2: 8 data observations (2017-2025 geographic expansion)  
- Agent 3: 1 data observation (2016 zero-transmission validation)
- Agent 4: 0 data observations (specialized source infrastructure mapping)
- Agent 5: 0 data observations (source permutation and methodology expansion)
- Total: 37 data observations spanning 1973-2025 with 2016 absence period
- Current sources: 21 validated sources across 4 reliability levels

=== QUALITY AUDIT FRAMEWORK ===
Primary Focus: Comprehensive validation of all 37 data observations and 21 metadata sources
Secondary Focus: URL verification, source validation, data integrity checks
Validation Standards: 4-tier reliability classification, epidemiological plausibility, cross-reference verification
Quality Metrics: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, epidemiological validity, source authentication

=== AGENT 6 QUALITY AUDIT PROTOCOL ===
1. Data integrity validation (cholera_data.csv)
2. Source authentication verification (metadata.csv)
3. Dual-reference indexing verification
4. Epidemiological plausibility assessment
5. Cross-reference validation across sources
6. URL verification and source accessibility
7. Quality scoring and confidence weight validation
8. Gap analysis and coverage assessment
9. Final dataset certification
10. Search report generation

Agent 6 Status: BEGINNING FINAL QUALITY AUDIT AND VALIDATION PROTOCOL

=== QUALITY AUDIT EXECUTION ===
Start Time: 12:35:25

PHASE 1: DATA INTEGRITY VALIDATION
✓ cholera_data.csv structure verification - 37 observations across 13 columns
✓ Dual-reference indexing verification - source_index and source columns validated
✓ Date logic validation - TL ≤ TR for all observations
✓ Epidemiological range validation - CFR values within 0.0-20.7% range
✓ Geographic coding validation - All locations use AFR::MOZ format
✓ Mathematical consistency validation - Deaths ≤ suspected cases where applicable

PHASE 2: SOURCE AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION  
✓ metadata.csv structure verification - 21 sources across 14 columns
✓ Source reliability classification - Level 1 (15 sources), Level 2 (5 sources), Level 3 (1 source)
✓ Index sequence validation - Sequential numbering 1-21 verified
✓ URL accessibility verification - All 21 URLs tested and documented
✓ Source description accuracy - All descriptions verified against actual content
✓ Cross-reference validation - Citation chains and academic references verified

PHASE 3: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY ASSESSMENT
✓ Temporal pattern validation - Seasonal outbreak patterns consistent with regional epidemiology
✓ Geographic pattern validation - Hotspot provinces (Sofala, Nampula, Zambézia) align with literature
✓ CFR validation - Range 0.0-20.7% with outliers documented and explained
✓ Outbreak duration validation - Reasonable epidemic timeframes documented
✓ Cross-border validation - Regional patterns consistent with neighboring country data
✓ Zero-transmission validation - 2016 absence period validated with surveillance confirmation

PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE DATA COVERAGE ASSESSMENT
✓ Temporal coverage: 1973-2025 (52 years) with comprehensive baseline and recent data
✓ Geographic coverage: National level (27 obs) + Provincial level (9 obs) + District level (1 obs)
✓ Source diversity: WHO (8), Academic (6), Government (3), Humanitarian (2), Regional (2)
✓ Data type diversity: Annual surveillance, outbreak reports, enhanced surveillance, laboratory data
✓ Quality distribution: Level 1 (71%), Level 2 (24%), Level 3 (5%) - Excellent quality profile
✓ Gap filling achievement: Critical 2016 absence period documented, comprehensive coverage achieved

PHASE 5: FINAL VALIDATION METRICS
✓ Data observation total: 37 validated observations
✓ Source authentication: 21 verified sources with working URLs
✓ Quality standards: 95% Level 1-2 sources, rigorous validation protocols applied
✓ Coverage completeness: Comprehensive temporal (1973-2025) and geographic (national-district) coverage
✓ Validation success rate: 100% of data observations passed validation protocols
✓ Epidemiological consistency: All observations consistent with cholera epidemiology patterns

=== AGENT 6 STATUS: QUALITY AUDIT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ===
All validation objectives achieved - Dataset certified for MOSAIC integration
