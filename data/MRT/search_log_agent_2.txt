=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ===
Country: Mauritania (MRT)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 14:50:15
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

OBJECTIVE: Provincial/district level data expansion and geographic breakdown
FOCUS: Nouadhibou, Nouakchott provinces, regional wilaya-level cholera data
SEARCH STRATEGY: Geographic-specific queries, administrative subdivision cholera cases
STOPPING CRITERIA: Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% yield, maximum 100 queries (5 batches)

=== BASELINE DATA STATUS ===
Current geographic coverage from Agent 1:
- AFR::MRT (national level): 2 observations (2005, 2011)
- AFR::MRT::Nouakchott (provincial level): 1 observation (2005)
Target expansions: Nouadhibou, other wilayas, district-level breakdowns

[14:50:20] AGENT 2 - STARTING GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION SEARCHES...

=== AGENT 2 - BATCH 1 STARTING: Provincial/wilaya level cholera data expansion ===
[14:50:25] BATCH 1 FOCUS: Nouadhibou, Adrar, Assaba, Brakna, Gorgol, Guidimaka, Hodh Ech Chargui, Hodh El Gharbi, Inchiri, Tagant, Tiris Zemmour, Trarza wilayas
[15:25:30] BATCH 1 COMPLETED: 20 queries executed, analyzing results for geographic data extraction...
[15:26:10] BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION: No additional quantitative cholera data found for CSV extraction
  - Confirmed administrative structure: 15 wilayas with functioning surveillance systems
  - Validated El Mina district details: 0.6% attack rate (same 2005 outbreak already documented)
  - Found Nouakchott subdivision (2014): Nord, Ouest, Sud regions with 9 districts total
  - Confirmed Riyad, El Mina, Sebkha, Dar Naim, Tevragh Zeina district-level outbreak context
  - No current cholera activity in any wilaya: Mauritania absent from 2024-2025 WHO reports
  - Cross-border surveillance active but no cholera transmission from Mali/Senegal borders
[15:26:10] BATCH 1 YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in new CSV rows = 0% yield (below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 2 - BATCH 2 STARTING: District-level breakdown and municipal data expansion ===
[15:26:15] BATCH 2 FOCUS: Municipal/commune level data, district breakdowns within existing provincial coverage
[16:15:45] BATCH 2 COMPLETED: 20 queries executed, analyzing results for administrative-level data extraction...
[16:16:20] BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION: No additional quantitative cholera data found for CSV extraction
  - Confirmed Mauritania administrative structure: 53 moughataas, 216 communes, systematic health surveillance
  - Found comprehensive health system organization: Regional Health Directorates, DHIS2 data management
  - Validated research limitation: Mauritania excluded from detailed analyses due to "insufficient sub-yearly data"
  - Confirmed 645 medical facilities including 18 general hospitals across administrative divisions
  - Historical data point found (2011: 3 deaths) but insufficient source attribution for reliable extraction
  - Reconfirmed current cholera-free status: absent from WHO surveillance reports 2024-2025
[16:16:20] BATCH 2 YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in new CSV rows = 0% yield (below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 2 COMPLETION ANALYSIS ===
[16:16:25] STOPPING CRITERIA MET:
✅ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries total)
✅ Consecutive batches below 5% threshold: Batches 1,2 both at 0% yield
✅ Geographic expansion phase complete

[16:16:25] AGENT 2 FINAL SUMMARY:
- Total queries executed: 40 (2 batches × 20 queries)
- Data observations added: 0 (no new quantitative cholera data discovered)
- Administrative structure mapped: 15 wilayas, 53 moughataas, 216 communes, 645 health facilities
- Geographic validation: El Mina district attack rate confirmed (0.6%, same 2005 outbreak)
- Current status validated: Mauritania cholera-free since 2011, absent from 2024-2025 WHO reports
- Research limitations identified: "insufficient sub-yearly data" explains limited district-level quantitative data

[16:16:25] AGENT 2 STATUS: COMPLETED - Proceeding to Agent 3
