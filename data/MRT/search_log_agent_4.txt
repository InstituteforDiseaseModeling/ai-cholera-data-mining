=== AGENT 4: OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ===
Country: Mauritania (MRT)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 17:28:00
Agent 4 Status: INITIALIZED

OBJECTIVE: Obscure source expansion and alternative database exploration
FOCUS: Historical archives, regional organizations, academic repositories, local media, specialized databases
SEARCH STRATEGY: Non-mainstream sources, institutional archives, thesis repositories, regional health databases
STOPPING CRITERIA: Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% yield, maximum 100 queries (5 batches)

=== BASELINE DATA STATUS ===
Current data observations: 7 (3 quantitative outbreak data + 4 zero-transmission periods)
- 2005: 1,087 cases (OCHA), ~1,000 patients Nouakchott (MSF)
- 2011: 46 cases (academic literature)
- Zero-transmission: 2006-2010, 2012-2015, 2016-2020, 2021-2025

Target expansion: Obscure historical sources, regional archives, specialized databases, academic theses, local government records

=== OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION PROTOCOL ===
Focus areas:
1. Academic thesis repositories (universities, research institutions)
2. Historical archives (colonial records, missionary reports)
3. Regional health organization databases (ECOWAS, CILSS)
4. Local media archives (Mauritanian press, regional news)
5. Specialized health databases (PROMED, Disease Outbreak News archives)
6. Government ministry archives (health statistics, annual reports)
7. International organization reports (World Bank, African Development Bank)
8. NGO documentation (local health organizations, humanitarian reports)

=== AGENT 4 - BATCH 1 STARTING: Academic repositories and historical archives exploration ===
[17:28:10] BATCH 1 FOCUS: University thesis repositories, historical archives, colonial records, academic databases
[18:15:45] BATCH 1 COMPLETED: 20 queries executed, analyzing results for obscure source data extraction...
[18:16:20] BATCH 1 INSTITUTIONAL DISCOVERIES: Extensive archive and database mapping completed
  📚 Academic repositories: French thesis databases, university research collections, ProQuest access
  🏛️ Colonial archives: ANOM (38km archives), French colonial medical records 1925-1961
  🌍 Regional organizations: ECOWAS/WAHO, REDISSE project, CILSS drought surveillance 
  📰 Media archives: Mauritanian press landscape, historical journalism resources
  🏥 NGO archives: MSF reports (already documented), Oxfam cholera guidelines, humanitarian databases
  🔬 Research networks: IRD/ORSTOM tropical medicine archives, HINARI medical access
  📊 Surveillance systems: PROMED database, WHO AFRO networks, regional cholera platforms
[18:16:20] BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION: No additional quantitative cholera data found for CSV extraction
  - Comprehensive institutional resource mapping completed across 20+ archive types
  - Strong evidence of surveillance system capacity but limited historical data accessibility
  - Multiple archive institutions identified (ANOM, IRD, missionary collections, university repositories)
  - Regional surveillance networks documented but no new case/death data discovered
[18:16:20] BATCH 1 YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in new CSV rows = 0% yield (below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 4 - BATCH 2 STARTING: Government archives, international organizations, local media, NGO documentation ===
[18:17:00] BATCH 2 FOCUS: Government ministry archives, international organization reports, local media archives, NGO documentation
[18:45:30] BATCH 2 COMPLETED: 20 queries executed, analyzing results for government and international organization data extraction...
[18:46:15] BATCH 2 INSTITUTIONAL FINDINGS: Comprehensive mapping of development organizations and health programs
  🏛️ Government archives: Mauritania Ministry of Health surveillance systems documented but limited public access
  🌍 International organizations: World Bank ($52.3M health program), AfDB ($18M water project), EU humanitarian aid
  📰 Local media landscape: Mauritanian press documented but limited archived cholera coverage accessible online
  🏥 NGO documentation: UNICEF, Oxfam, Care, Save the Children, ICRC, Action Against Hunger programs mapped
  💰 Development funding: Multiple donor health programs identified (French cooperation, USAID, GIZ, JICA, CIDA)
  🚰 WASH infrastructure: Extensive water/sanitation projects but no cholera-specific case data discovered
[18:46:15] BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION: No additional quantitative cholera data found for CSV extraction
  - Comprehensive development organization resource mapping completed across 20+ institution types
  - Strong evidence of health system investments but no accessible cholera surveillance statistics
  - Multiple WASH and health infrastructure projects documented but no outbreak case/death data
  - International development community presence well-documented but cholera data remains elusive
[18:46:15] BATCH 2 YIELD: 0/20 queries resulted in new CSV rows = 0% yield (below 5% threshold)

=== AGENT 4 COMPLETION ANALYSIS ===  
[18:46:30] STOPPING CRITERIA MET:
✅ Minimum 2 batches completed (40 queries total)
✅ Consecutive batches below 5% threshold: Batches 1,2 both at 0% yield  
✅ Obscure source expansion phase complete

[18:46:30] AGENT 4 FINAL SUMMARY:
- Total queries executed: 40 (2 batches × 20 queries)
- Data observations added: 0 (no new CSV entries)
- Institutional mapping: 40+ archive/database types systematically explored
- Development programs: Comprehensive donor and NGO landscape documented
- Data accessibility: Limited public access to Mauritanian government health archives
- International presence: Strong development community presence but cholera data gaps persist

[18:46:30] AGENT 4 STATUS: COMPLETED - Proceeding to Agent 5
