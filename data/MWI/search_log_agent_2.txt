MANDATORY STOPPING CRITERIA:
- Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stop when: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
- Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)
- Data observation yield = queries that add NEW rows to cholera_data.csv / 20 queries per batch

CURRENT DATA BASELINE:
- National level: 11 observations (AFR::MWI)
- District level: 6 observations (Mangochi, Machinga, Lilongwe, Nkhata Bay, Karonga, Salima)
- Lake Chilwa: 1 observation
- Total: 17 observations from Agent 1

GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION TARGETS:
1. Missing districts: 23 of 29 districts not yet documented
2. Cross-border transmission patterns with Mozambique/Tanzania/Zambia
3. Regional disease surveillance network data
4. Lake Malawi cholera transmission patterns
5. Urban vs rural transmission dynamics
