=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Malawi (MWI)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 12:55:00
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 3: ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION ===
Objective: Document and validate cholera-free periods + absence confirmation + surveillance system validation

MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL:
All validated cholera-free periods MUST be documented as data observations in cholera_data.csv with specific format:
- Location: AFR::{ISO} (national level for absence periods)
- TL/TR: Start and end of absence period
- deaths: 0, sCh: 0, CFR: 0.0
- Source: WHO surveillance confirmation or academic validation
- Confidence_weight: 0.8-1.0 based on surveillance quality
- Processing_notes: "Source confirms zero cholera transmission during [period] - validated absence via [surveillance system]"

TARGET ABSENCE PERIODS FOR VALIDATION:
1. 2013-2014: Gap between major outbreaks
2. 2017-2019: Gap before major 2022 outbreak
3. Pre-1998: Before endemic period establishment
4. 2010-2011: Gap between documented outbreaks
5. Seasonal absence periods within outbreak years

MANDATORY STOPPING CRITERIA:
- Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stop when: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
- Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)
- Data observation yield = queries that add NEW rows to cholera_data.csv / 20 queries per batch

CURRENT DATA BASELINE (Agent 1+2):
- Total observations: 31 rows
- Documented years: 1988, 1998-1999, 2000, 2001-2002, 2008-2010, 2011-2012, 2015-2016, 2022-2024
- Identified gaps requiring validation: 2013-2014, 2017-2019, pre-1998, 2003-2007

ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION TARGETS:
1. WHO surveillance confirmation of cholera-free periods
2. Academic documentation of absence periods with epidemiological evidence
3. Government health ministry reports confirming zero cholera cases
4. Regional surveillance networks documenting cholera-free status
5. Cross-border analysis confirming absence despite regional transmission
