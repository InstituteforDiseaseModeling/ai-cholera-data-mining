=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Malawi (MWI)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 13:35:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION ===
Objective: Explore variations of successful search strategies + permute high-yield terms + exhaust adjacent domains

MANDATORY STOPPING CRITERIA:
- Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stop when: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
- Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)
- Data observation yield = queries that add NEW rows to cholera_data.csv / 20 queries per batch

CURRENT DATA BASELINE (Agents 1-4):
- Total observations: 35 rows (including 3 zero-transmission periods)
- Geographic coverage: 23 of 29 districts documented (79%)
- Historical coverage: 1973-2025 with validated gaps filled
- Key data sources: WHO, academic journals, government reports, NGO assessments

SUCCESSFUL TERMS FROM PREVIOUS AGENTS:
- High-yield: "WHO Disease Outbreak News", "PMC", "ReliefWeb", "UNICEF"
- Geographic: District names, "Lake Chilwa", "fishing communities", "Shire River"
- Temporal: "2022-2023", "2015-2016", "2008-2009", "1998-2012"
- Medical: "case fatality rate", "surveillance", "genomic", "oral cholera vaccine"

SOURCE PERMUTATION STRATEGIES:
1. Permute successful domain/organization combinations
2. Alternative spelling/terminology variations
3. Adjacent time periods to known outbreaks  
4. Combine successful geographic + temporal terms
5. Cross-reference successful sources with different contexts
6. Explore mirror sites and alternative access points
7. Regional organization variations (SADC, ECOWAS, AU)
8. Academic institution variations and partnerships
9. Alternative publication formats (preprints, conference proceedings)
10. International organization country office variations
