=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Namibia (NAM)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 15:22:15
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 3: ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION ===
Objective: Systematic year-by-year drilling (2015-2024) with confidence weighting for zero-transmission periods
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for zero-transmission validation
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Quality Requirements: Must maintain ≥90% Level 1-2 source reliability

Agent 1 & 2 Results Foundation:
- Sources discovered: 9 (metadata.csv Index 1-9)
- Data observations: 9 (cholera_data.csv Index 1-9)
- Time period coverage: 2006-2025 (19-year span)
- Geographic coverage: National, Kunene, Ohangwena, Windhoek
- Quality distribution: Level 1 (56%), Level 2 (33%), Level 3 (11%)
- Key Gap Identified: 2015-2024 decade-long absence period (ECDC validation)

Agent 3 Focus Areas:
- Systematic year-by-year validation of 2015-2024 absence period
- Cross-border transmission analysis (Angola endemic vs Namibia cholera-free)
- Surveillance system functionality validation during absence periods
- Regional outbreak pattern analysis (SADC countries 2015-2024)
- Zero-transmission period documentation in cholera_data.csv (MANDATORY)

CRITICAL ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
All validated cholera-free periods MUST be documented as data observations in cholera_data.csv using:
- Location: AFR::NAM (national level for absence periods)
- TL/TR: Start/end dates of validated absence periods
- deaths: 0, sCh: 0, cCh: (empty), CFR: 0.0
- confidence_weight: 0.8-1.0 based on surveillance system quality
- processing_notes: Source confirmation of zero transmission with validation method
