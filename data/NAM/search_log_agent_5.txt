Start Time: 2025-07-24 15:40:15
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION & ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Objective: Exhaustive permutation of search terms and exploration of adjacent data sources for comprehensive coverage
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for source permutation and adjacent data mining
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Quality Requirements: Must maintain appropriate source validation for alternative terminology approaches

Agents 1-4 Results Foundation:
- Sources discovered: 10 (metadata.csv Index 1-10)
- Data observations: 9 (cholera_data.csv Index 1-9)
- Time period coverage: 2006-2025 (19-year span)
- Geographic coverage: National, Kunene, Ohangwena, Windhoek
- Zero-transmission period: 2015-2024 validated and documented
- Quality distribution: Level 1 (60%), Level 2 (30%), Level 3 (10%)

Agent 5 Focus Areas:
- Exhaustive search term permutation and combination strategies
- Adjacent health condition mining (AWD, diarrheal diseases, waterborne illnesses)
- Alternative terminology approaches (clinical, vernacular, regional terms)
- Cross-reference mining from existing sources for citation chains
- Related surveillance system exploration (WASH, environmental health, food safety)
- Mining of tangential data sources (climate, migration, refugee, emergency response)
- Regional comparative mining (Angola, Botswana, Zambia cross-border analysis)
- Historical event correlation mining (droughts, floods, conflicts, elections)
- Alternative case definition mining (suspected vs confirmed cases)
- Source chain permutation from discovered references

SOURCE PERMUTATION & ADJACENT DATA MINING STRATEGY:
- Term Permutation: Systematic combination of "cholera" with all possible modifiers
- Adjacent Condition Mining: AWD, diarrheal disease, gastroenteritis, dehydration outbreaks
- Alternative Terminology: Clinical terms, vernacular expressions, regional language variants
- Cross-Reference Mining: Citation following from all discovered sources
- Surveillance Permutation: IDSR, EWARN, DHIS2, surveillance system variations
- Geographic Permutation: All administrative levels with alternative spellings
- Temporal Permutation: Decade combinations, seasonal patterns, event correlations
- Adjacent Data Sources: WASH assessments, nutrition surveys, refugee health
- Regional Pattern Mining: Cross-border transmission analysis and prevention
- Historical Context Mining: Post-independence health system development patterns
