=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Niger (NER)
Start Time: 2025-01-24 20:20:00
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION OBJECTIVES ===
Focus: Administrative subdivision drilling (provinces, districts, municipalities)
Target: Provincial and district-level cholera data across Niger's 8 regions
Methodology: Systematic geographic drilling with cross-border transmission analysis
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for geographic expansion baseline
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Maximum Queries: 100 queries (5 batches)

=== NIGER ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE ===
8 Regions for Geographic Drilling:
1. Agadez Region (northern, desert, minimal population)
2. Diffa Region (southeastern, Lake Chad basin, refugee populations)
3. Dosso Region (southwestern, Niger River valley, agricultural)
4. Maradi Region (south-central, high density, known cholera activity)
5. Niamey Capital District (urban center, Niger River)
6. Tahoua Region (central-west, pastoral, recent 2024 outbreak)
7. Tillabery Region (western, Niger River, Ayorou 2024 outbreak)
8. Zinder Region (central-east, second largest city, trade hub)

=== AGENT 1 BASELINE SUMMARY ===
Agent 1 established foundational data with:
- 20 data observations spanning 2003-2024
- Geographic coverage: National (AFR::NER), Maradi region/district, Tillabery::Ayorou, Tahoua region
- Key gaps identified: Limited district-level data, missing regions (Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Niamey, Zinder)
- Cross-border patterns: Nigeria-Niger transmission documented

=== AGENT 2 GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION STRATEGY ===
Priority 1: Drill down into regions with known activity (Maradi, Tahoua, Tillabery)
Priority 2: Systematic coverage of unrepresented regions (Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Niamey, Zinder)
Priority 3: District and municipal level data extraction
Priority 4: Cross-border transmission patterns with neighboring countries
Priority 5: Regional health system capacity and surveillance networks
