=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Niger (NER)
Start Time: 2025-01-24 21:30:00
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED

=== ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION OBJECTIVES ===
**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY**: Systematic validation and documentation of ALL cholera-free periods
Focus: Zero-transmission validation, temporal gap-filling, absence period documentation
Methodology: Comprehensive surveillance validation with cross-border regional analysis
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for temporal validation baseline
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Maximum Queries: 100 queries (5 batches)

=== TEMPORAL COVERAGE ANALYSIS ===
Based on Agent 1 and Agent 2 findings, Niger cholera data spans:

**Documented Periods** (with cases):
- 2003-2015: National surveillance (16,328 cases, 578 deaths)
- 2006-2008: Maradi region (403 cases, 18 deaths)
- 2018: National outbreak (3,692 cases, 68 deaths)
- 2021: National epidemic (5,572 cases, 166 deaths)
- 2022: SURGE response (68 cases, 2 deaths)
- 2024: Multiple regional outbreaks (881 cases, 18 deaths)

**Validated Zero-Transmission Periods**:
- 2009: Confirmed cholera-free period (national surveillance validation)
- 2021: Agadez region zero cases during national epidemic

**CRITICAL GAPS REQUIRING VALIDATION**:
- 2000-2002: Pre-surveillance period validation needed
- 2010-2017: Gap between Maradi study and national outbreak
- 2016-2017: Surveillance gap requiring validation
- 2019-2020: Gap between 2018 and 2021 outbreaks
- 2023: Gap between 2022 and 2024 outbreaks

=== AGENT 3 ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION STRATEGY ===
**Priority 1**: Validate identified gaps (2010-2017, 2019-2020, 2023)
**Priority 2**: Cross-border validation (Chad, Nigeria, Mali outbreaks vs Niger absence)
**Priority 3**: Regional absence validation (provinces cholera-free during national outbreaks)
**Priority 4**: Surveillance system functioning validation during absence periods
**Priority 5**: Historical pre-2000 absence documentation

=== MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL ===
All validated cholera-free periods MUST be documented as data observations in cholera_data.csv with:
- Location: AFR::NER (national) or AFR::NER::{REGION} (regional)
- TL/TR: Start/end dates of absence period
- deaths: 0, sCh: 0, cCh: (empty), CFR: 0.0
- Source: WHO surveillance, academic studies, government reports
- Confidence weight: 0.8-1.0 based on surveillance quality
- Processing notes: Exact source quotes confirming absence
