=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Nigeria (NGA)
Agent: Zero-transmission validation
Start Time: 2025-07-23 17:05:30
Max Queries: 100 (5 batches)
Min Queries: 40 (2 batches)
Stop Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Focus: Zero-transmission validation and outbreak-free interval documentation
Priority Gap: 2022-08-22 to 2023-01-01
Missing Historical Years: 2000-2009
Current Data Status: 27 observations, 19 sources

MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL:
- Document validated absence periods as data observations in cholera_data.csv
- sCh=0, deaths=0, CFR=0.0 for absence periods
- Source must confirm zero transmission or functioning surveillance
- Focus on gap periods between documented outbreaks
- Cross-reference with neighboring countries' outbreak patterns
- Validate surveillance system operation during absence periods

=== BATCH 1 START - 17:06:15 ===
BATCH 1 COMPLETE - 17:09:45 - 20 queries executed
BATCH 1 YIELD: 0 validated zero-transmission periods found, 0/20 queries successful = 0% yield

CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM BATCH 1:
- Priority Gap 2022-08-22 to 2023-01-01: ACTIVE CHOLERA TRANSMISSION confirmed
  * Borno State: 12,496 cases, 394 deaths (Sept 17 - Dec 23, 2022)
  * Major outbreak period, not cholera-free
- Historical 2000s: NO validated absence periods identified
  * Evidence shows endemic cholera since 1972
  * Documented cases in 2001 (724 cases, 52 deaths)
  * Surveillance data 2004-2008 (74,881 cases)
- Surveillance limitations: ~10% case capture rate per WHO estimates
- Regional context: Nigeria among most affected West African countries

=== BATCH 2 START - 17:11:00 ===
BATCH 2 COMPLETE - 17:15:30 - 20 queries executed
BATCH 2 YIELD: 0 validated zero-transmission periods found, 0/20 queries successful = 0% yield

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS FROM BATCH 2:
- Inter-outbreak periods 1999-2004: Documented cholera activity in 2001 (724 cases)
- Seasonal patterns: Cholera occurs in BOTH dry and wet seasons (reduced but not absent)
- Regional differences: Both northern and southern states affected (Lagos highest cases 2024)
- State-level analysis: No states documented as "cholera-free" (FCT Abuja also affected)
- Cross-border patterns: Nigeria part of Lake Chad transmission network
- WHO validation: No evidence of transmission interruption validation periods
- Post-outbreak surveillance: Nigeria continues reporting cases through 2025

=== AGENT 3 SUMMARY ===
Total batches completed: 2 (minimum requirement met)
Total queries executed: 40 (minimum 40 queries reached)
Yield pattern: 0%, 0%
Stopping criteria status: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield threshold - CRITERIA MET
Zero-transmission documentation: NO validated absence periods identified
Agent 3 Status: COMPLETED - Zero-transmission validation complete

CRITICAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDING:
Nigeria has NO documentable zero-transmission periods since cholera became endemic in 1972.
This confirms continuous transmission patterns essential for MOSAIC modeling parameters.
Evidence shows Nigeria as one of most affected African countries with ongoing endemic transmission.
