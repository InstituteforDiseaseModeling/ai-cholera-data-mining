Batch Duration: 25 minutes

=== BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION RESULTS ===
CSV Updates Completed:
- metadata.csv: No new sources with quantitative cholera data requiring addition
- cholera_data.csv: No new quantitative geographic data observations identified

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0.0% (0 successful queries / 20 queries)
- Successful queries: 0 (no queries resulted in new cholera_data.csv rows)
- Total queries executed: 20
- Geographic mapping comprehensive but no quantitative data additions

=== BATCH 2 EXECUTION: CROSS-BORDER & REGIONAL HEALTH COORDINATION ===
Batch Start Time: 2025-07-24 18:35:00
Target: 20 parallel queries - Cross-border transmission analysis, health sector reports, surveillance coordination
Query Type: Regional surveillance networks, health sector performance reports, HMIS data, cross-border coordination
Running Total: 40 queries completed (2 batches), minimum requirement met

BATCH 2 RESULTS SUMMARY:
- 20 parallel searches executed focusing on cross-border transmission, health coordination, surveillance systems
- CROSS-BORDER INSIGHTS: DRC-Rwanda cholera risk confirmed, regional surveillance networks documented

=== AGENT 2 STOPPING CRITERIA ANALYSIS ===
MINIMUM BATCH REQUIREMENT: ✅ COMPLETED (2 batches / 40 queries)
STOPPING CRITERIA ASSESSMENT:
- Batch 1: 0.0% yield (<5% threshold)
- Batch 2: 0.0% yield (<5% threshold) 
- CONSECUTIVE LOW YIELD: ✅ ACHIEVED (Batches 1 & 2 both <5%)
