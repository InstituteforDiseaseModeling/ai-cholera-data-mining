=== RWANDA SOURCE PERMUTATION STRATEGY ===
SYSTEMATIC PERMUTATION CATEGORIES:
1. **Alternative Query Syntax**: Reframe successful Agent 1 queries with different syntax approaches
2. **Source Chain Extensions**: Follow references from discovered sources to find additional related materials
3. **Temporal Adjacency Mining**: Search periods immediately adjacent to discovered outbreak periods
4. **Geographic Adjacency Mining**: Search neighboring administrative regions and cross-border connections
5. **Subject Matter Permutations**: Explore related health topics that may include cholera data (diarrheal diseases, WASH, emergency response)
6. **Publication Type Variations**: Same sources searched with different document type constraints
7. **Language Permutations**: Alternative language formulations and technical terminology variations
8. **Organizational Hierarchies**: Explore parent/subsidiary organizations of successful sources

PERMUTATION METHODOLOGY:
- **Successful Source Expansion**: Take Agent 1's successful sources and explore their institutional hierarchies
- **Adjacent Topic Mining**: Search for broader health emergencies that may have included cholera
- **Reference Chain Following**: Use citations and references from discovered sources
- **Temporal Extension**: Search periods immediately before/after known outbreaks
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Use multiple approaches to verify and expand existing findings

TARGET PERMUTATION CATEGORIES:
1. WHO AFRO (successful in Agent 1) → WHO headquarters, WHO regional committees, WHO country office archives
2. CDC MMWR (referenced) → CDC surveillance reports, CDC field epidemiology training, CDC emergency response
3. UNICEF (humanitarian response) → UNICEF evaluation reports, UNICEF emergency coordinators, UNICEF WASH programs
4. Academic literature → Citation networks, author publication histories, institutional affiliations
5. Government sources → Ministry archives, health statistics bulletins, annual health reports
