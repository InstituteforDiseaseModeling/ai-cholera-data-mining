[16:30:15] BATCH 3 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: WHO WER 1995 cholera documentation, Fann Hospital bacteriology surveillance 1981-1990 (592 V. cholerae isolates), zero-transmission validation 2000-2003, ORSTOM/IRD demographic surveillance since 1983, UCAD historical thesis 1816-1960, current WHO absence confirmation 2024-2025

[16:31:00] BATCH 3 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 6 sources added to metadata.csv, 6 observations added to cholera_data.csv  
Data Observation Yield: 6/20 = 30% (well above 10% threshold)
Quality: All Level 1 sources, zero-transmission documentation validated, institutional deep dive successful

[16:31:15] BATCH 4 COMMENCING - Advanced temporal expansion and source diversification
Focus: Pre-1995 historical gaps, international archives, linguistic diversity, alternative databases

[16:45:30] BATCH 4 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: WHO French WER archives 1971/1973, Portuguese colonial medical records 1973, seventh pandemic introduction documentation, French colonial surveillance system 1912, international cooperation context (CDC, MSF, ICRC, Wellcome, JICA, USSR)

[16:46:00] BATCH 4 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 5 sources added to metadata.csv, 0 observations added to cholera_data.csv  
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 10% threshold but continuing to minimum 5 batches)
Quality: All Level 1-2 archival sources, extensive historical documentation, international scope validated

[16:46:15] BATCH 5 COMMENCING - Final systematic coverage and gap validation
Focus: Alternative search terms, specialized databases, outbreak-specific searches, final historical gaps

[17:15:45] BATCH 5 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: Comprehensive surveillance system information, French language source validation, academic research confirmation, current absence validation for 2024-2025, regional cholera context, control measures documentation, but no new quantitative data discovered

[17:16:00] BATCH 5 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 0 sources added to metadata.csv, 0 observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 10% threshold)
Quality: Comprehensive information gathering, no new quantitative data sources

[17:16:15] AGENT 1 STOPPING CRITERIA MET
Consecutive Batches Below Threshold: Batch 4 (0%) + Batch 5 (0%) = 2 consecutive batches <10%
Minimum Batches Completed: 5 batches ✓ (100 total queries)
Final Agent 1 Status: COMPLETED - Baseline establishment successful

=== AGENT 1 FINAL SUMMARY ===
