=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Senegal (SEN)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 17:20:00
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION AND DISTRICT-LEVEL DRILLING ===
Objective: District/provincial level geographic drilling and administrative breakdown
Requirements: Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Quality Target: ≥80% Level 1-3 source reliability
Maximum Limit: 100 queries (5 batches)

=== GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS AREAS ===
Based on Agent 1 findings, key regions for expansion:
- Dakar Region: Major 2005 outbreak (5,474 cases), 1995-1996 Fann Hospital data
- Diourbel Region: 2005 outbreak epicenter, 2007 outbreak (>85% of cases)
- Thiès Region: 2005 co-epicenter with Dakar
- Saint-Louis Region: Historical outbreaks, northern regional patterns
- Fatick Region: Cross-referenced in multiple outbreaks
- Other regions: Kaolack, Tambacounda, Louga

=== SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: Regional administrative breakdown searches
Phase 2: District-level health data mining
Phase 3: Provincial surveillance system deep dives
Phase 4: Sub-national geographic validation

[17:25:00] BATCH 1 COMMENCING - Regional and district-level geographic expansion
Focus: Administrative breakdown by region/district, provincial surveillance systems, sub-national geographic validation

[17:45:30] BATCH 1 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: District-level breakdowns for multiple regions, provincial hospital networks, CHR regional facilities, surveillance system infrastructure, administrative divisions, geographic-specific outbreak data for Mbour (52 cases), Saint-Louis city (1,185 cases 2004-2005), Foundiougne district (119 cases, 2 deaths), Touba-Mbacké-Bambey districts (2,054 cases, 8 deaths), Bakel district (5 cases), Darou Mousty (>861 cases, 6 deaths)

[17:46:00] BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 6 new geographic-specific sources added to metadata.csv, 8 district/provincial observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 8/20 = 40% (well above 5% threshold)
Quality: Level 1-2 WHO and government sources, district-level administrative validation successful
Geographic Coverage: Successfully expanded to district/provincial level for multiple regions

[18:15:00] BATCH 2 COMMENCING - Cross-border analysis and remaining regional coverage
Focus: Cross-border transmission patterns, remaining regions (Ziguinchor, Kolda, Sédhiou, Matam, Kaffrine, Kédougou), health zone structures, surveillance infrastructure

[18:35:45] BATCH 2 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: Cross-border transmission patterns with Guinea-Bissau/Mali/Mauritania/Guinea documented, Kédougou health vulnerabilities due to mining identified, comprehensive surveillance infrastructure mapping, health zone structures documented, but limited new quantitative data discovered

[18:36:00] BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 2 new cross-border sources added to metadata.csv, 0 observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold, but continuing as only 1 batch below threshold)
Quality: Level 1-2 surveillance system and cross-border documentation, infrastructure mapping successful
Geographic Coverage: Cross-border patterns established, remaining regions surveyed

[19:05:00] BATCH 3 COMMENCING - Detailed district validation and institutional deep dives
Focus: Specific district-level validation, administrative structures, health facility networks, laboratory surveillance, HDSS sites, institutional research platforms

[19:25:30] BATCH 3 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: Comprehensive HDSS surveillance sites documented (Niakhar, Bandafassi, Mlomp), Institut Pasteur Dakar laboratory capabilities established, health facility infrastructure mapped, but no new quantitative cholera data discovered

[19:26:00] BATCH 3 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 2 new institutional sources added to metadata.csv, 0 observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
Quality: Level 1 institutional and surveillance documentation, infrastructure mapping comprehensive

[19:26:15] AGENT 2 STOPPING CRITERIA MET
Consecutive Batches Below Threshold: Batch 2 (0%) + Batch 3 (0%) = 2 consecutive batches <5%
Minimum Batches Completed: 3 batches ✓ (60 total queries)
Final Agent 2 Status: COMPLETED - Geographic expansion successful

=== AGENT 2 FINAL SUMMARY ===
Total Batches: 3 (60 queries)
Total Sources Added: 10 new geographic/institutional sources to metadata.csv
Total Observations Added: 8 district/provincial observations to cholera_data.csv
Average Data Observation Yield: 8/60 = 13.3%
Quality Achievement: ≥80% Level 1-2 source reliability
Geographic Success: District-level expansion achieved, cross-border patterns documented, surveillance infrastructure mapped
Major Discoveries: Sub-national geographic breakdowns, institutional surveillance networks, HDSS research platforms, laboratory capabilities
