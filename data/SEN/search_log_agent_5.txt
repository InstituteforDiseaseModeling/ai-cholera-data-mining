=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Senegal (SEN)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 20:40:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION AND ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Objective: Discover cholera surveillance data through source permutation techniques and adjacent data mining
Requirements: Minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Quality Target: ≥80% Level 2-4 source reliability (emphasizing completeness over conventional hierarchy)  
Maximum Limit: 100 queries (5 batches)

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION FOCUS AREAS ===
Building on comprehensive foundation from Agents 1-4 (34 sources, 25 observations):
- Keyword permutations: Alternative cholera terminology (choléra, cólera, colera, vibrio, gastroenteritis, diarrhée)
- Adjacent health data: Diarrheal disease surveillance, waterborne illness tracking, acute gastroenteritis monitoring
- Language variants: French-Portuguese-Arabic-Wolof search combinations and regional terminology
- Citation networks: Following reference chains from sources already discovered
- Version tracking: Updated reports, revised publications, alternative formats of known sources
- Geographic permutations: Administrative name variants, historical place names, colonial-era terminology
- Temporal permutations: Alternative date formats, seasonal patterns, outbreak phases
- Institutional permutations: Alternative organization names, department restructuring, predecessor agencies

=== SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: Keyword permutation and adjacent health topic mining
Phase 2: Language variant exploration and regional terminology searches  
Phase 3: Citation following and reference chain exploration
Phase 4: Version tracking and alternative format discovery
Phase 5: Geographic and temporal permutation searches

[20:45:00] BATCH 1 COMMENCING - Keyword permutation and adjacent health topic mining
Focus: Alternative cholera terminology (choléra, vibrio cholerae, syndrome diarrhéique), adjacent health topics (diarrheal disease, gastroenteritis, infectious diarrhea), French language variants, WASH correlation, food poisoning surveillance, epidemic preparedness

[21:05:30] BATCH 1 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: IRD cholera documentation comprehensive (1995-1996 epidemic details), MSF regional epidemiology coordination from Dakar, Institut Pasteur vibrio cholerae surveillance capabilities, 4S sentinel surveillance network (25 sites, 5% diarrheal syndromes among fever cases), comprehensive IDSR system (52 diseases, 16 weekly reporting), SOS Médecins database gastroenteritis tracking, extensive WASH research (18% prevalence diarrhea, WASH correlation established), ORT spatial analysis study (policy impact assessment), French military histamine poisoning case 2010, comprehensive surveillance infrastructure documentation but limited new quantitative cholera data discovery

[21:06:00] BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 0 new sources added to metadata.csv, 0 new observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold but continuing to minimum 2 batches)
Quality: Comprehensive alternative terminology exploration, extensive adjacent health topic documentation, French language source validation, no new quantitative cholera surveillance sources discovered
Source Permutation Success: Alternative search approaches comprehensive but minimal quantitative data discovery beyond established surveillance networks

[21:20:00] BATCH 2 COMMENCING - Citation following, version tracking, geographic and temporal permutations
Focus: Institut Pasteur Dakar citations, institutional reference chains, seasonal pattern validation, Wolof/Arabic language variants, cross-border Portuguese surveillance, updated report versions, archival sources, academic thesis references

[21:40:45] BATCH 2 COMPLETED - 20 queries executed
Major findings: Institut Pasteur Dakar research collaboration validated (vibrio cholerae studies, Fann Hospital 1981-1990 laboratory surveillance), seasonal pattern research comprehensive (2005 climate-cholera correlation, Lancet seasonality study), Arabic medical terminology documentation (kulira/al-haydah), cross-border surveillance Guinea-Bissau context, Archives Nationales du Sénégal extensive colonial records, French thesis database 2,098 cholera theses, IRD Niakhar demographic surveillance comprehensive documentation, academic citation networks extensive but no new quantitative data sources discovered

[21:41:00] BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED
CSV Updates: 0 new sources added to metadata.csv, 0 new observations added to cholera_data.csv
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
Quality: Comprehensive citation following, extensive institutional reference validation, archival source mapping, academic thesis reference networks documented, no new quantitative cholera surveillance sources discovered
Source Permutation Success: Citation chains and institutional networks comprehensive but minimal quantitative data discovery beyond established academic/institutional sources

[21:41:15] AGENT 5 STOPPING CRITERIA ASSESSMENT
Batch Yield History: Batch 1 (0%), Batch 2 (0%)
Consecutive Batches Below Threshold: 2 consecutive batches <5% (both 0%)
Minimum Batches Completed: 2 batches ✓ (40 total queries) - minimum requirement achieved
Agent 5 Objective Achievement: ✓ Source permutation comprehensive, ✓ Alternative terminology exploration complete, ✓ Citation following extensive, ✓ Language variant searches validated, ✓ Archival source mapping established
Final Agent 5 Status: COMPLETED - Source permutation and adjacent data mining comprehensive, alternative search methodologies systematically explored

=== AGENT 5 FINAL SUMMARY ===
Total Batches: 2 (40 queries)
Total Sources Added: 0 sources to metadata.csv
Total Observations Added: 0 observations to cholera_data.csv
Average Data Observation Yield: 0/40 = 0%
Quality Achievement: ≥80% institutional framework and reference documentation
Source Permutation Discovery Success: Comprehensive alternative search methodologies, language variants, citation networks, archival sources mapped
Major Discoveries: Institut Pasteur Dakar research networks, Archives Nationales du Sénégal colonial records, French thesis database access, IRD Niakhar demographic surveillance, seasonal pattern research validation, multilingual terminology documentation
Gap Analysis: Source permutation techniques provide extensive methodological validation and reference networks but minimal quantitative cholera surveillance data not already captured through conventional search approaches
