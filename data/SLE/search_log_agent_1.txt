=== AGENT 1 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Sierra Leone (SLE)
Start Time: 2025-08-01 16:11:00
Agent 1 Status: INITIALIZED

=== SIERRA LEONE GAP ANALYSIS ===
Based on ./reference/agent_quick_reference.csv:
- Coverage: 100.0% (complete coverage for core surveillance period)
- Data span: 2011-2019 (existing complete coverage)
- Search priority: LOW (due to high existing coverage)
- Missing recent years: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009
- Priority periods: Pre-2011 and Post-2019 data

=== GAP-TARGETED SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Focus areas for Agent 1:
1. PRIORITY: Pre-2011 historical data (1970-2010)
2. PRIORITY: Post-2019 recent data (2020-2025)  
3. SECONDARY: Validation of 2011-2019 coverage completeness
4. Cross-border validation with Guinea and Liberia

=== AGENT 1 BASELINE ESTABLISHMENT ===
Objective: Execute 8-phase search protocol with batch-based stopping criteria
Minimum: 5 batches (100 queries) 
Stopping criteria: 2 consecutive batches <10% data observation yield
Maximum: 200 queries (10 batches)

=== EXISTING DATA ANALYSIS ===
Current cholera_data.csv: 9 observations
Current metadata.csv: 9 sources with dual-reference indexing
Major periods covered:
- 2012: Major outbreak (22,815 cases, 296 deaths) - WELL DOCUMENTED
- 2020-2024: Zero transmission period - DOCUMENTED
- 1970: First outbreak - MENTIONED BUT NEEDS QUANTIFICATION
- 1994-1995: Major outbreak - MENTIONED BUT NEEDS QUANTIFICATION  
- 2000-2010: Four outbreaks - MENTIONED BUT NEEDS QUANTIFICATION

=== PRIORITY GAPS IDENTIFIED ===
1. HIGHEST PRIORITY: Quantify 2000-2010 four outbreaks (currently only mentioned)
2. HIGH PRIORITY: Recent surveillance 2019-2025 (validate zero transmission post-2019)
3. HIGH PRIORITY: Pre-2000 historical data (1970s-1990s quantification)
4. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Geographic granularity for documented outbreaks

=== BATCH 1 EXECUTION ===
[16:12:15] Starting Batch 1 (Queries 1-20) - Focus: 2000-2010 outbreak quantification

BATCH 1 RESULTS (Queries 1-20):
[16:13:45] All 20 searches completed targeting 2000-2010 period
- Confirmed "four outbreaks from 2000-2010" reference from existing data
- Found consistent historical context: 1970 first outbreak, 1985/1994-1995 major outbreaks
- 2012 confirmed as largest since 1970, deadliest since 1994-1995
- NO specific quantitative data found for individual 2000-2010 outbreaks
- WHO, academic, and government sources searched systematically
- ZERO new rows added to cholera_data.csv

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (No successful queries that added new data)

Key insights:
- 2000-2010 period well-documented as having 4 outbreaks but quantitative data scarce
- Most sources focus on well-documented 2012 outbreak  
- Historical references consistent across multiple authoritative sources
- Need different search strategy for Batch 2

=== BATCH 2 EXECUTION ===
[16:14:00] Starting Batch 2 (Queries 21-40) - Focus: Recent surveillance 2019-2025 & historical pre-2000

BATCH 2 RESULTS (Queries 21-40):
[16:15:30] All 20 searches completed targeting recent & historical periods
- Found Sierra Leone became first African country with full electronic surveillance (2019)
- Confirmed high risk status for cholera as of 2023 but no active cases reported
- MAJOR DISCOVERY: Detailed 2012 provincial breakdown data not in existing cholera_data.csv
- Western Area: 4,965 cases, 63 deaths, 0.95% attack rate (more detailed than existing entry)
- Port Loko: 2,806 cases, 45 deaths (specific district data not previously captured)
- Historical searches (1970, 1985, 1994-1995) found context but no specific quantitative data
- Northern Provincial Hospital: 798 patients, 18 deaths, 2.3% CFR (already captured)

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (CORRECTION: Found data already exists in CSV)

CORRECTION AFTER CSV REVIEW:
- Western Area 4,965 cases/63 deaths already captured in Index 17
- Port Loko 2,806 cases/45 deaths already captured in Index 18
- No new quantitative data actually added to cholera_data.csv
- Searches validated existing data quality and provided additional context

Key discoveries:
- Electronic surveillance transformation 2019 supports zero-transmission documentation capability
- Confirmed accuracy of existing 2012 provincial data in cholera_data.csv
- Cross-border Guinea-Liberia patterns documented for context
- Surveillance system strengthening post-2012 well documented

CONSECUTIVE BATCHES: Batch 1 (0%) + Batch 2 (0%) = 2 consecutive <10%
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: Must complete 5 batches (100 queries) before applying stopping criteria
CONTINUING TO BATCH 3 - Need 3 more batches to reach minimum threshold

=== BATCH 3 EXECUTION ===
[16:16:00] Starting Batch 3 (Queries 41-60) - Focus: Provincial granularity & specific outbreak quantification

BATCH 3 RESULTS (Queries 41-60):
[16:20:30] All 20 searches completed targeting provincial granularity & specific outbreak quantification
- Systematic search across districts: Bombali, Kenema, Bo, Kailahun, Kambia, Pujehun, Koinadugu, Bonthe
- Historical outbreak periods: 2008, 2006, 2007, 1985, 1995, 2002-2005, 2009-2010, 1970, 1994, 2001
- Cross-validation of existing data: All discovered quantitative data already captured in cholera_data.csv
- KEY DISCOVERY: Kailahun was only district NOT affected in 2012 outbreak (potential zero-transmission data)
- Provincial validation: Bombali 35 cases, Kenema 18 cases, cross-border patterns confirmed
- Historical validation: 1985 CFR 8.6%, 2008 outbreak 62 cases, 1970 West African pandemic 400,000+ regional cases
- ZERO new rows added to cholera_data.csv - all discovered data already comprehensively captured

BATCH 3 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (No successful queries that added new data)

Key insights:
- Sierra Leone cholera_data.csv appears exceptionally comprehensive (37 observations)
- Provincial and district-level data well-documented for 2012 outbreak
- Historical context validated but specific quantitative data scarce for pre-2012 periods
- Cross-border transmission patterns with Guinea well-documented
- Zero-transmission validation confirms high surveillance quality post-2012

CONSECUTIVE BATCHES: Batch 1 (0%) + Batch 2 (0%) + Batch 3 (0%) = 3 consecutive <10%
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: Must complete 5 batches (100 queries) before applying stopping criteria
CONTINUING TO BATCH 4 - Need 2 more batches to reach minimum threshold

=== BATCH 4 EXECUTION ===
[16:21:00] Starting Batch 4 (Queries 61-80) - Focus: Historical deep-dive & surveillance system validation

BATCH 4 RESULTS (Queries 61-80):
[16:25:45] All 20 searches completed targeting historical deep-dive & surveillance system validation
- WHO WER archives: Identified specific 2006-2010 WER publications but no Sierra Leone quantitative data found
- Surveillance system development: IDSR implemented 2008, WHO collaboration since 1970s for Lassa fever
- Historical institutional responses: MSF (1986, 1995, 2006-2007), European Commission aid (1995), UNICEF coordination
- Academic/university research: Limited historical epidemiological studies from 1970s-2000s period
- Demographic surveys: First DHS only in 2008, no cholera mortality data in MICS 1995-2005
- Newspaper archives: Media disruption during civil war, limited digital archives from target period
- All discovered information consistent with existing cholera_data.csv coverage
- ZERO new rows added to cholera_data.csv - comprehensive historical validation but no novel quantitative data

BATCH 4 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (No successful queries that added new data)

Key insights:
- Sierra Leone surveillance system development well-documented post-2008 IDSR implementation
- Historical institutional memory consistent across WHO, MSF, European Commission records
- Civil war period (1991-2002) severely impacted health system documentation
- Pre-digital era archives remain largely inaccessible through web searches
- Existing cholera_data.csv demonstrates exceptional historical comprehensiveness

CONSECUTIVE BATCHES: Batch 1 (0%) + Batch 2 (0%) + Batch 3 (0%) + Batch 4 (0%) = 4 consecutive <10%
MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: Must complete 5 batches (100 queries) before applying stopping criteria
CONTINUING TO BATCH 5 - Need 1 more batch to reach minimum threshold

=== BATCH 5 EXECUTION ===
[16:26:00] Starting Batch 5 (Queries 81-100) - Focus: Zero-transmission validation & final verification

BATCH 5 RESULTS (Queries 81-100):
[16:30:15] All 20 searches completed targeting zero-transmission validation & final verification
- Post-2012 surveillance: Electronic system 2019, OCV campaign 2017, preparedness plan 2013-2017
- Zero-transmission validation: Kailahun district unaffected 2012 (only district spared), civil war surveillance collapse 1996-1999
- Regional cross-validation: Guinea-Liberia cross-border meetings, seasonal patterns (dry season lower risk)
- Laboratory capacity: Diagnostic capabilities established 2012-2013, current capacity for 10 diseases including cholera
- Academic validation: Multiple studies confirming existing outbreak data, no absence period studies found
- Current status 2024: Sierra Leone NOT listed in WHO active cholera transmission reports (suggesting current absence)
- All discovered information validates existing cholera_data.csv comprehensiveness
- ZERO new rows added to cholera_data.csv - extensive validation but no novel quantitative data

BATCH 5 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (No successful queries that added new data)

Key validation insights:
- Kailahun district confirmed as only area unaffected in 2012 outbreak (validates existing zero-transmission documentation)
- Electronic surveillance system since 2019 supports robust absence validation capacity
- Civil war period (1996-1999) represents surveillance system collapse rather than disease absence
- Current WHO reports exclude Sierra Leone from active transmission countries (2024 status validation)
- Seasonal patterns suggest lower transmission during dry season but no complete absence validation found
