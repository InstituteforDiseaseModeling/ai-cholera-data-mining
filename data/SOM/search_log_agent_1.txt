- Historical expansion: 2017 major outbreak (78,701 cases, 1,163 deaths)
- Added 4 new Level 1-2 sources to metadata.csv with enhanced dual-reference indexing
BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION: 3 successful queries / 20 total queries = 15% data observation yield
BATCH 2 COMPLETED - CONTINUING (yield >10% threshold)

=== BATCH 3 START (Agent 1) ===
Time: 2025-07-24 18:52:29
Batch 3/20: Academic literature and citation network expansion
BATCH 3 DATA EXTRACTION COMPLETED:
- Extensive academic literature review identified multiple peer-reviewed sources
- Found academic research database with systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Limited new quantitative data extracted from academic sources (mostly qualitative research)
BATCH 3 YIELD CALCULATION: 1 successful query / 20 total queries = 5% data observation yield
BATCH 3 COMPLETED - YIELD BELOW 10% THRESHOLD (5% yield)

=== BATCH 4 START (Agent 1) ===
Time: 2025-07-25 06:42:15
Batch 4/20: Historical extension and surveillance system analysis
BATCH 4 SEARCH RESULTS:
- Found limited historical data for 2002-2009 missing period (mostly qualitative context)
- Identified surveillance system improvements over time, WHO laboratory confirmation protocols
- Extensive environmental monitoring and water quality surveillance information
- Cross-border transmission patterns with Kenya/Ethiopia documented
- WASH intervention impact analysis with dramatic case reductions
- Community-based surveillance and case management protocols
BATCH 4 DATA EXTRACTION: Limited quantitative yield (primarily surveillance infrastructure documentation)
BATCH 4 YIELD CALCULATION: 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0% data observation yield
BATCH 4 COMPLETED - SECOND CONSECUTIVE BATCH BELOW 10% THRESHOLD (0% yield)

=== BATCH 5 START (Agent 1) ===
Time: 2025-07-25 06:43:45
Batch 5/20: Deep historical excavation focusing on missing years 2000-2009
BATCH 5 SEARCH RESULTS:
- Attempted intensive searches for 2001-2016 historical surveillance data using exact year searches
- Found strong evidence of colonial period cholera (British Somaliland protectorate 1890s-1930s)
- Identified major 2011 cholera outbreak as part of 2010-2019 decade analysis
- Located 2016 outbreak surveillance data (14,165 cases, 497 deaths, CFR 3.51%)
- WHO surveillance system development through EWARN reconstruction post-conflict
- Colonial disease patterns: cholera introduced through imperial armies/displacement
BATCH 5 DATA EXTRACTION: Found 1 new quantitative data point (2016 outbreak data)
BATCH 5 YIELD CALCULATION: 1 successful query / 20 total queries = 5% data observation yield
BATCH 5 COMPLETED - THIRD CONSECUTIVE BATCH BELOW 10% THRESHOLD (5% yield)

AGENT 1 STOPPING CRITERIA MET: Completed 5 minimum batches with 3 consecutive below 10% threshold
AGENT 1 FINAL SUMMARY:
- Total batches: 5
- Total queries: 100
