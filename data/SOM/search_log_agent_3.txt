=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Somalia (SOM)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 08:20:30
Agent 3 Status: STARTING ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION PROTOCOL
Gap Analysis: 59.6% coverage, HIGH priority
Priority Gap Period: 2019-07-29 to 2023-01-01 (FILLED by Agent 1)
Missing Historical Years: 2000-2009 (systematic validation required)
Current Data Span: 2000, 2016-2025 (Agent 2 enhanced coverage)
Mission: Validate cholera-free periods and document confirmed absence of transmission
Strategy: Gap period verification, surveillance system validation, cross-border confirmation
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)

ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION TARGETS:
1. 2001-2015 historical gap period (15-year absence requiring validation)
2. Surveillance system capacity during absence periods
3. Cross-border validation with Ethiopia/Kenya patterns
4. WHO "zero reporting" confirmation for gap years
5. Academic documentation of cholera-free periods
6. Regional context validation (neighboring country patterns)

=== BATCH 1 START (Agent 3) ===
Time: 2025-07-25 08:20:45
Batch 1/20: Systematic validation of 2001-2015 historical gap period
BATCH 1 SEARCH RESULTS:
- 2001-2003 period: No WHO surveillance confirming zero cases found
- 2004-2006 surveillance: No validated cholera-free evidence
- 2007-2009 gap investigation: Evidence shows 2008 had cholera transmission (2-month delay)
- 2010-2012 WHO EMRO: EWARN launched 2010 but collapsed; major 2011 outbreak (77,636 cases)
- 2013-2015 surveillance capacity: EWARN collapsed 2014-2015; small-scale outbreaks documented
- Surveillance system absence: No reliable system 2008-2016 due to civil conflict
- Historical epidemiology: Somalia long faced cholera outbreaks since 1970s
- Academic validation: Recent studies show endemic pattern since 2017, earlier periods poorly documented
- Cross-border evidence: Ethiopia/Kenya had cholera 2001-2015; regional transmission documented
- Critical finding: 2001-2015 represents surveillance gaps rather than validated cholera absence
BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION: Found 0 validated zero-transmission periods for cholera_data.csv
BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION: 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0% data observation yield
BATCH 1 COMPLETED - BELOW 5% THRESHOLD (0% yield)

=== BATCH 2 START (Agent 3) ===
Time: 2025-07-25 08:25:15
Batch 2/20: Validation of surveillance system collapse periods and evidence gaps
BATCH 2 SEARCH RESULTS:
- EWARN surveillance system: Introduced 2008, deactivated 2008-2016 due to civil conflict
- WHO validation context: "Except for 2002, cholera CFR in Somalia always higher than global/regional averages"
- Surveillance collapse evidence: EWARN collapsed 2014-2015, server moved to Nairobi due to infrastructure destruction
- Civil conflict impact: No reliable surveillance 2008-2016, health system severely damaged
- Cross-border validation: Ethiopia/Kenya cholera 2001-2015 confirmed regional transmission patterns
- Academic consensus: Regional burden difficult to capture due to weak surveillance and underreporting
- 2002 exception evidence: WHO data shows 2002 was exceptional year for Somalia cholera patterns
- Surveillance vs absence: Evidence suggests apparent gaps represent surveillance failures, not disease absence
- Academic validation: Small-scale outbreaks 2008-2010 and 2014-2015 documented despite system collapse
- Endemic pattern: For past 3 decades, Somalia outbreaks coincided with global/regional cholera patterns
BATCH 2 DATA EXTRACTION: Found 0 validated zero-transmission periods for cholera_data.csv
BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION: 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0% data observation yield
BATCH 2 COMPLETED - SECOND CONSECUTIVE BATCH BELOW 5% THRESHOLD (0% yield)

AGENT 3 STOPPING CRITERIA MET: Completed 2 minimum batches with 2 consecutive below 5% threshold
AGENT 3 FINAL SUMMARY:
- Total batches: 2
- Total queries: 40
- Data yield progression: 0% â†’ 0%
- Zero-transmission validation: NO validated cholera-free periods identified
- Surveillance system evidence: EWARN collapsed 2008-2016 due to civil conflict
- Critical finding: 2001-2015 represents surveillance gaps rather than validated disease absence
- Academic consensus: Small-scale outbreaks occurred 2008-2010 and 2014-2015 despite limited surveillance
- WHO validation: "Except for 2002" suggests most other years had documented cholera presence
- Regional context: Cross-border patterns with Ethiopia/Kenya confirm ongoing transmission
- Enhanced dataset: NO zero-transmission data observations added to cholera_data.csv
AGENT 3 STATUS: COMPLETED - READY FOR AGENT 4

=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Agent: Agent 4 (Obscure source expansion)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 08:30:00
Agent 4 Status: STARTING OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION PROTOCOL
Mission: Discovery of rare, specialized, and non-traditional cholera surveillance sources
Strategy: Non-WHO databases, local archives, specialist publications, alternative data sources
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)
