=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Somalia (SOM)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 08:45:15
Agent 5 Status: STARTING SOURCE PERMUTATION AND ADJACENT DATA MINING PROTOCOL
Gap Analysis: 59.6% coverage, HIGH priority
Enhanced Coverage: Agent 1 filled priority gaps 2019-2022, Agent 2 added 32+ districts/regions
Zero-transmission Assessment: Agent 3 confirmed surveillance gaps not validated absence
Obscure Sources: Agent 4 explored 40+ specialized archives with comprehensive documentation
Mission: Exhaustive permutation of existing sources and mining of adjacent/related data streams
Strategy: Cross-reference validation, alternative data interpretation, temporal expansion
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries)

SOURCE PERMUTATION TARGETS:
1. Cross-reference existing sources for missing temporal data
2. Alternative interpretations of vaccination/demographic data
3. Secondary citations and reference chains from found sources
4. Adjacent disease surveillance (diarrheal diseases, waterborne illnesses)
5. Infrastructure development reports with embedded health data
6. Climate/environmental correlations with outbreak patterns
7. Alternative search terms and synonyms for cholera
8. Population movement data with health implications
9. Economic indicators correlated with health outcomes
10. Regional surveillance networks and cross-border data

- Maternal mortality surveillance: 621/100,000 maternal deaths, surveillance system gaps, pregnancy complications
- Education disruption: 814,000 children affected by closures, school infrastructure damage increases waterborne disease risk
- Agricultural productivity: Seasonal flooding/drought cycles, displacement to camps, livelihood-health correlations
- Livelihood security: Pastoral communities vulnerable, traditional systems disrupted, climate-conflict-disease nexus
- Conflict displacement: Protracted conflict main driver, 1.4M displaced 2022, insecurity-cholera correlation documented
- Technology surveillance: 10,000 mHealth recipients, EWARN mobile app, 80% facilities submitting electronic data
- Humanitarian funding: Chronic underfunding vs outbreak emergency responses, US$2M CERF allocation timing
- Demographic health: First SHDS 2020, 31,198 households, higher-than-average cholera mortality documented
- Urban transmission: Mogadishu informal settlements, 700,000 displaced, 10 latrines for 1,800 people at Raama Cadey
BATCH 1 DATA EXTRACTION: Found 0 quantitative data observations suitable for cholera_data.csv
BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION: 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0% data observation yield
BATCH 1 COMPLETED - BELOW 5% THRESHOLD (0% yield)
