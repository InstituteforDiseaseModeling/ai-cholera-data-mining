### Major Findings

#### Confirmed Outbreak Periods
- **2017 Major Outbreak**: 78,701 cases, 1,163 deaths (CFR 1.48%) - largest since 1970
- **2020-2022 Resurgence**: 6,414 cases (2020), 6,205 cases (2021), 7,796 cases (2022)
- **2016 Historical**: 14,165 cases, 497 deaths (CFR 3.51%)
- **2000 Baseline**: 2,232 cases, 230 deaths (CFR 10.3%)

#### Surveillance System Evolution
- **2008-2016**: EWARN system collapse due to civil conflict, no reliable surveillance
- **2017-2020**: EWARN reactivation during drought/cholera response
- **2021-Present**: Transition to Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR)

#### Cross-Border Patterns
- **Regional Transmission**: Ethiopia-Somalia-Kenya cross-border outbreaks documented
- **IGAD Coordination**: Trilateral cooperation agreements, joint surveillance protocols
- **Mandera Triangle**: Multi-agency action plan 2016-2019 for cross-border response

### Gap Analysis Results

#### Filled Gaps
- **Priority Period 2019-2022**: Successfully filled through systematic WHO EMRO, government, and humanitarian source mining
- **Geographic Detail**: Enhanced from national aggregates to district/municipal precision
- **Recent Outbreaks**: Comprehensive 2020-2025 documentation with provincial breakdowns

#### Confirmed Surveillance Gaps
- **2001-2015 Period**: Represents surveillance system failure, not validated disease absence
- **Academic Consensus**: Small-scale outbreaks occurred 2008-2010 and 2014-2015 despite limited surveillance
- **Cross-Border Evidence**: Ethiopia/Kenya had cholera 2001-2015, confirming regional transmission continued

#### Remaining Limitations
- **Pre-2000 Historical**: Limited surveillance infrastructure for deeper historical analysis
- **Rural Coverage**: Some remote areas likely underrepresented in official surveillance
- **Alternative Terminology**: AWD (Acute Watery Diarrhea) standard, potential underreporting of cholera classification
