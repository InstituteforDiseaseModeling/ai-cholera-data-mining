=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: South Sudan (SSD)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 10:30:00
Agent 3 Status: INITIALIZED
Previous Results: Agent 1 (18 sources, 29 observations), Agent 2 (14 sources, 15 observations)

AGENT 3 PROTOCOL:
- Focus: Zero-transmission validation and cholera-free period documentation
- Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stopping criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
- Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)
- CRITICAL MISSION: Document ALL validated cholera-free periods as data observations

ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION STRATEGY:
- Systematic validation of gaps between documented outbreaks
- WHO surveillance confirmation of zero-transmission periods
- Academic documentation of absence periods with epidemiological evidence
- Cross-border analysis to confirm absence during regional transmission
- Surveillance system functioning validation during absence periods

MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION ENTRY REQUIREMENTS:
- Location: AFR::SSD (national level for absence periods)
- TL/TR: Start/end dates of validated absence period
- deaths: 0, sCh: 0, CFR: 0.0
- Source: WHO surveillance or academic validation
- confidence_weight: 0.8-1.0 based on surveillance quality
- processing_notes: Must include exact source quote confirming absence
