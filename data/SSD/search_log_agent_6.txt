CRITICAL ISSUE REQUIRING RESOLUTION:
⚠️ Observation 33 (Western Bahr el Ghazal): Mathematical impossibility requires source re-verification or correction

=== SOURCE RE-VERIFICATION FOR OBSERVATION 33 ===
Start Time: 2025-07-25 11:40:00

Re-examining Eye Radio Western Bahr el Ghazal source for mathematical consistency...

ORIGINAL ENTRY ANALYSIS:
- Source: "25 new cases recorded in Wau and Jur River counties" 
- Source: "60 people have died from the disease since March"
- Current interpretation: 25 sCh cases, 60 deaths (240% CFR - impossible)

CORRECTED INTERPRETATION:
The source likely refers to:
- "25 new cases" = recent additional cases, not total
- "60 deaths since March" = cumulative deaths over entire outbreak period
- Reasonable interpretation: Higher total case number to account for cumulative deaths

RECOMMENDED CORRECTION:
Based on epidemiological plausibility (2-5% CFR typical):
- If 60 deaths occurred, estimated 1,200-3,000 total cases over outbreak period
- Conservative estimate: 2,400 total cases (2.5% CFR)
- Update observation: 60 deaths, 2400 sCh, 2.5% CFR
