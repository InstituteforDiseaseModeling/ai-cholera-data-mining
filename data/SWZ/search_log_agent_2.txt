=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Eswatini (SWZ)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 20:29:00
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ===
Target: Provincial/district level cholera data mining with geographic granularity
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)

Geographic Focus Areas:
- Hhohho region (Mbabane capital)
- Manzini region (commercial center)
- Shiselweni region (southern border with South Africa)
- Lubombo region (eastern border with Mozambique - 2023 transmission source)

BATCH 1 COMPLETED (20 searches):
[20:30:15] Hhohho region searches - found general WHO cholera status confirmation, no district-level data
[20:30:26] Manzini region searches - confirmed existing 2023 outbreak data, no district-specific breakdown
[20:30:37] Shiselweni region searches - found border surveillance context, no specific district case data
[20:30:48] Lubombo region searches - confirmed cross-border transmission data already documented
[20:30:59] Mbabane district searches - found hospital infrastructure but no specific cholera cases by district
[20:31:10] Manzini city searches - found surveillance infrastructure but no district-level cholera data
[20:31:21] Siteki border searches - found border crossing context but no specific surveillance data
[20:31:32] Nhlangano searches - found MSF healthcare programs but no cholera surveillance data
[20:31:43] Provincial breakdown searches - confirmed national data already documented, no new breakdowns
[20:31:54] Geographic distribution searches - confirmed 2023 outbreak data, no new geographic details

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS - BATCH 1:
✓ Administrative structure confirmed: 4 regions (Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni, Lubombo) with 55 tinkhundla
✓ Border crossings identified: Lavumisa/Golela (South Africa), Lomahasha/Namaacha (Mozambique)
✓ Population distribution: Manzini region most populous (33%), Hhohho second (29%)
✓ Health infrastructure: Regional hospitals in each region, network of clinics and health centers
✓ Traditional authorities: Chiefs administer rural areas through communal land tenure system
✓ Rural Health Motivators: 4,000+ community health workers since 1976 provide surveillance support
✓ Cross-border health risks: Lubombo region has poorest sanitation access, highest cross-border movement
✓ Industrial centers: Matsapha (largest industrial site), Manzini (commercial capital)
✓ Mountain regions: Pigg's Peak in Hhohho with limited access but health facilities available
✓ Surveillance integration: Tinkhundla system exists but no documented cholera-specific reporting protocols

DATA EXTRACTION: No new quantitative data observations added
SOURCES ADDED: No new sources with district/provincial-level cholera data

BATCH 1 YIELD CALCULATION:
Data observation yield = 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0%
CONTINUE: Yield <5% but minimum 2 batches required, proceeding to Batch 2

BATCH 2 COMPLETED (20 searches):
[20:32:01] Manzini hospital/district searches - found RFM Hospital information but no district-level cholera case data
[20:32:12] Lubombo region clinic searches - confirmed Good Shepherd Hospital and health infrastructure but no district cases
[20:32:23] Hhohho Mbabane investigation searches - found general WHO cholera confirmation but no epidemiological investigation details
[20:32:34] Shiselweni border surveillance searches - confirmed regional health context but no specific district surveillance data
[20:32:45] Tinkhundla reporting system searches - detailed governance structure but no cholera-specific reporting protocols
[20:32:56] Hospital-level cholera searches - comprehensive facility information but no quantitative cholera patient data
[20:33:07] Regional health facility searches - detailed infrastructure mapping but no cholera case distributions
[20:33:18] Cross-border screening searches - extensive border health measures but no specific cholera screening data
[20:33:29] Industrial area risk assessment - found Matsapha cholera risk assessment (91/242 homesteads have toilets)
[20:33:40] Community surveillance searches - comprehensive RHM system details but no cholera reporting specifics

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS - BATCH 2:
✓ Hospital infrastructure: RFM Hospital (350-bed regional referral), Good Shepherd Hospital (Siteki), Hlatikhulu Government Hospital
✓ Laboratory capacity: EHLS network with diagnostic capabilities, molecular reference laboratory systems
✓ Border surveillance: Lavumisa-Golela and Lomahasha border posts with health screening protocols
✓ Industrial risk areas: Matsapha industrial area with identified WASH infrastructure deficits (69% lack adequate toilets)  
✓ Community health workers: Rural Health Motivators (RHMs) system since 1976 with 4,000+ volunteers
✓ Traditional governance: Tinkhundla system (55 tinkhundla, 385 chiefdoms) provides community-government linkage
✓ FETP training: Eswatini health professionals access South Africa FETP program for epidemiological capacity
✓ Laboratory services: EHLS provides national reference services with specimen transport network
✓ Surveillance integration: IDNS 977 toll-free system for immediate disease notification with electronic data management
✓ WHO country support: WHO country office surveillance reports confirm 2023 outbreak data already documented

DATA EXTRACTION: No new quantitative data observations added
SOURCES ADDED: No new sources with district/provincial-level cholera data

BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION:
Data observation yield = 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0%
STOPPING CRITERIA MET: 2 consecutive batches (1,2) with 0% yield, both below 5% threshold

=== AGENT 2 SUMMARY ===
Total Queries: 40 (2 batches × 20 queries)
Total Data Observations: 0 (no new district/provincial-level data found)
Total Sources: 0 (no new quantitative data sources)
Overall Yield: 0% (0 successful queries out of 40 total)

AGENT 2 CONCLUSION:
Geographic expansion searches completed with comprehensive coverage of hospital systems, laboratory networks, border surveillance, administrative structures, and community health systems. Confirmed that Eswatini's 2023 cholera outbreak (2 cases, 0 deaths, April 4-18) was managed at national level with limited geographic spread requiring district-level documentation. Strong surveillance infrastructure exists through EHLS laboratory network, IDNS 977 reporting system, and Rural Health Motivators, but no district-specific cholera case breakdowns were found in available sources. The brief, contained nature of the 2023 outbreak likely explains the absence of detailed geographic distribution data.

Agent 2 Status: COMPLETED
