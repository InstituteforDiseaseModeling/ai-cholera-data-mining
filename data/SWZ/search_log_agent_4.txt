CRITICAL FINDINGS FOR OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION:
✗ No quantitative cholera data discovered from deep archive exploration
✗ Alternative terminology searches (diarrhea, gastroenteritis) yielded non-cholera outbreaks only
✗ Specialized databases and repositories contain institutional records but lack accessible cholera surveillance data
✗ Regional coordination mechanisms extensively documented but do not provide country-specific quantitative data
✗ Historical surveillance documentation gaps confirmed across multiple search approaches
✗ Academic literature exclusions validate insufficient cholera data availability rather than discovering new sources

DATA EXTRACTION: No new quantitative data observations added to cholera_data.csv
SOURCES ADDED: No new sources with quantitative cholera data

BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION:
Data observation yield = 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0%
STOPPING CRITERIA MET: 2 consecutive batches (1,2) with 0% yield, both below 5% threshold

=== AGENT 4 SUMMARY ===
Total Queries: 40 (2 batches × 20 queries)
Total Data Observations: 0 (no quantitative data discovered from obscure sources)
Total Sources: 0 (no new sources with quantitative cholera data)
Overall Yield: 0% (0 successful queries out of 40 total)

AGENT 4 CONCLUSION:
Obscure source expansion searches completed with comprehensive coverage of non-traditional sources including historical archives, specialized databases, professional associations, industry groups, parliamentary records, media archives, traditional medicine systems, and regional coordination mechanisms. While extensive institutional frameworks and surveillance systems exist across multiple sectors (mining, tourism, railways, traditional healing, regional health organizations), none yielded quantitative cholera data suitable for epidemiological analysis. The systematic exclusion of Eswatini from academic studies due to "insufficient data" was validated across multiple medical journals and research databases. Historical surveillance gaps were confirmed through Internet Archive, Library of Congress, and specialized repository searches. The brief, contained nature of Eswatini's 2023 cholera outbreak (2 cases, 0 deaths, 15-day duration) appears consistent with historically low cholera transmission in the country, explaining the absence of quantitative data in non-traditional sources.
