=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Eswatini (SWZ)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 01:48:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION AND ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Target: Search term permutations and adjacent data discovery through systematic query variations
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries)
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Maximum: 100 queries (5 batches)

Source Permutation Strategy:
- Alternative disease terminology combinations
- Reverse chronological search approaches  
- Adjacent surveillance data mining (neighboring diseases, conditions)
- Institutional synonym variations and historical name changes
- Cross-reference mining from discovered sources
- Methodology permutations (surveillance vs. notification vs. reporting)
- Geographic and administrative permutations
- Temporal permutation searches across different time frames
- Language and translation variations
- Citation network exploration from existing sources

Focus Areas for Permutation:
- Swaziland/Eswatini name variations with different term combinations
- Cholera/diarrhea/gastroenteritis/dysentery cross-referencing
- Epidemic/outbreak/endemic terminology variations
- Surveillance/monitoring/reporting/notification system permutations
- 2023 outbreak reverse-reference mining for historical context
- Regional outbreak citation networks (Zimbabwe 2008, Mozambique 2023)
- WHO/Africa CDC/SADC document cross-reference exploration
- Academic citation mining from Lancet exclusion studies
- Government ministry alternative department searches
- International organization subdivision exploration

DATA EXTRACTION: No new quantitative data observations added to cholera_data.csv
SOURCES ADDED: No new sources with quantitative cholera data

BATCH 2 YIELD CALCULATION:
Data observation yield = 0 successful queries / 20 total queries = 0%
STOPPING CRITERIA MET: 2 consecutive batches (1,2) with 0% yield, both below 5% threshold

=== AGENT 5 SUMMARY ===
Total Queries: 40 (2 batches × 20 queries)
Total Data Observations: 0 (no quantitative data discovered through source permutation approaches)
Total Sources: 0 (no new sources with quantitative cholera data)
Overall Yield: 0% (0 successful queries out of 40 total)

AGENT 5 CONCLUSION:
Source permutation and adjacent data mining searches completed with comprehensive coverage of terminology variations, reverse reference mining, adjacent disease surveillance systems, and cross-reference validation approaches. While extensive health surveillance infrastructure was confirmed across multiple disease areas (typhoid, hepatitis A, shigella, salmonella, food poisoning), none yielded quantitative cholera data suitable for epidemiological analysis. Alternative disease terminology searches confirmed strong surveillance capacity for other diarrheal diseases but did not reveal hidden cholera data. Cross-reference mining validated the completeness of existing 2023 outbreak documentation rather than discovering new sources. The systematic exclusion patterns observed (academic studies, regional surveillance gaps, infrastructure without cholera-specific data) were consistent across all permutation approaches. Eswatini's brief, contained 2023 cholera outbreak (2 cases, 0 deaths, 15-day duration) and historically low cholera burden appear to accurately reflect the limited quantitative data availability discovered through exhaustive source permutation approaches.
