=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Chad (TCD)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 22:06:30
Agent 2 Status: INITIALIZED - Geographic expansion and provincial-level data mining

=== AGENT 2 MISSION: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION ===
Objective: Expand geographic granularity and discover provincial/district/municipal level cholera data
Focus Areas: Administrative subdivisions, regional health networks, local outbreak reports
Target: Provincial (AFR::TCD::PROVINCE), District (AFR::TCD::PROVINCE::DISTRICT), Municipal levels
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries), Maximum: 5 batches (100 queries)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield

=== CURRENT CHAD GEOGRAPHIC DATA COVERAGE ===
From Agent 1 (15 observations, 12 sources):
- National Level: 6 observations
- Regional Level: 6 observations (Sila, Salamat, Mayo Kebbi Est/Ouest, Mongo, Hadjer Lamis)
- District Level: 2 observations (Koukou district)  
- Village Level: 1 observation (Marena village)

Target Expansion: Additional provinces, districts, health districts, municipalities
Geographic Priorities: N'Djamena, Logone Oriental, Moyen Chari, Kanem, Lac, Batha, Ouaddai

=== AGENT 2 SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: Provincial health administration searches
Phase 2: District health surveillance searches  
Phase 3: Municipal and community health searches
Phase 4: Geographic cross-referencing and validation

Data Observation Yield Calculation: NEW cholera_data.csv rows with geographic specificity
Required Documentation: Geographic codes, administrative hierarchy validation

=== BATCH 1/20 EXECUTION - START TIME: 22:06:45 ===

Query Results Summary:
- 0 of 20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions
- Key findings: Comprehensive provincial surveillance frameworks, regional health coordination structures, refugee crisis impacts
- Geographic scope: 14 Chad provinces covered (Logone Oriental, Moyen Chari, Ouaddai, Batha, Kanem, Lac, Wadi Fira, Ennedi Est, Tibesti, Borkou, Tandjile, Mandoul, Chari-Baguirmi, Guera)
- Surveillance context: Health district systems, provincial health delegations, cross-border coordination, WHO surveillance portals
- Infrastructure coverage: Municipal health systems, health zones with 200m risk assessment, administrative coordination frameworks
- Regional preparedness: Sudan refugee crisis response, border surveillance, Lake Chad basin coordination

=== BATCH 1 COMPLETION - TIME: 22:15:00 ===
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (BELOW 5% threshold - first batch)
CSV Updates: No new data added - metadata.csv (12 sources), cholera_data.csv (15 observations)
Coverage Status: First batch below threshold, minimum 2 batches required before stopping

=== BATCH 2/20 EXECUTION - START TIME: 22:15:30 ===

Query Results Summary:
- 0 of 20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions
- Key findings: District-level health surveillance frameworks, cross-border coordination, municipal health systems
- Geographic scope: 14 Chad districts covered (Logone Oriental, Moyen Chari, N'Djamena, Kanem, Lac, Batha, Ouaddai, Chari-Baguirmi, Mandoul, Tandjile, Guera, Mayo Kebbi, Sila, Salamat, Hadjer Lamis)
- Surveillance context: Health district hierarchies, municipal health surveillance, local government coordination, sous-prefecture systems
- Infrastructure coverage: District health delegations, commune surveillance, health zone administration, local response coordination
- Preparedness insights: Cross-border cholera prevention, endemic surveillance sites, regional health delegation structures

=== BATCH 2 COMPLETION - TIME: 22:25:00 ===
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (BELOW 5% threshold - second consecutive batch)
CSV Updates: No new data added - metadata.csv (12 sources), cholera_data.csv (15 observations)
Coverage Status: STOPPING CRITERIA MET - 2 consecutive batches below 5% threshold

=== AGENT 2 COMPLETION STATUS ===
COMPLETED: Agent 2 geographic expansion
Total Batches: 2 (minimum requirement met)
Total Queries: 40 (minimum requirement met)
Data Observation Yields: 0%, 0% (stopping criteria satisfied)
Final Data Count: 15 cholera observations, 12 sources (no new data added)
Agent 2 Status: SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED - proceeding to Agent 3

=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
