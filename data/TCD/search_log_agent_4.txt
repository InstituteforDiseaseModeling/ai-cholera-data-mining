=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Chad (TCD)
Start Time: 2025-07-24 22:45:30
Agent 4 Status: INITIALIZED - Obscure source expansion and unconventional data mining

=== AGENT 4 MISSION: OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ===
Objective: Discover cholera data from grey literature, unconventional sources, and non-mainstream repositories
Focus Areas: Academic dissertations, NGO internal reports, historical archives, institutional repositories, specialized databases
Target: Obscure sources not captured by mainstream search engines or Agent 1-3 systematic searches
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries), Maximum: 5 batches (100 queries)
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield

=== CURRENT CHAD DATA COVERAGE STATUS ===
From Agents 1-3 (15 observations, 12 sources):
- Temporal Coverage: 2001-2019 (major outbreaks documented)
- Source Types: WHO (4), ReliefWeb (3), UNICEF (2), Academic (2), Government (1)
- Missing Source Types: Grey literature, institutional repositories, historical archives, local reports

Agent 4 Target Sources:
- University repositories and institutional archives
- NGO internal reports and field assessments  
- Historical archives and colonial records
- Specialized databases and grey literature portals
- Local research institutions and health networks

=== AGENT 4 SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: University and academic repository mining
Phase 2: NGO and humanitarian organization internal reports
Phase 3: Historical archives and governmental records
Phase 4: Specialized databases and grey literature portals

Data Observation Yield Calculation: NEW cholera_data.csv rows from obscure sources
Required Documentation: Source authentication, institutional validation, archive verification

=== BATCH 1/20 EXECUTION - START TIME: 22:46:00 ===

Query Results Summary:
- 0 of 20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions
- Key findings: University repositories lack Chad-specific cholera dissertations; grey literature portals had no Chad cholera content; historical colonial archives general but no specific Chad cholera records; Institut Pasteur research mentions Lake Chad Basin cholera patterns but no quantitative Chad data; regional research centers note Chad NPHI establishment 2023; bilateral cooperation documentation general but lacks specific cholera data; military/peacekeeping sources reference refugee health services but no cholera outbreaks; anthropological studies from Cameroon relevant to region but no Chad specifics; WASH studies mention Chad water treatment behavior research; religious organization health services historical but no specific cholera records; local media directories found but no vernacular cholera reports with data
- Search coverage: Academic institutions, grey literature portals, historical archives, research institutions, bilateral cooperation agencies, military health services, anthropological research, environmental health studies, religious organizations, local media sources
- Validation challenges: Most sources provided contextual information about cholera research methodologies, regional patterns, or institutional frameworks rather than specific quantitative data about Chad cholera outbreaks
- Institutional findings: Africa CDC noted Chad established NPHI 2023, GIZ ended bilateral cooperation 2012, International Medical Corps providing refugee health services

=== BATCH 1 COMPLETION - TIME: 22:50:00 ===
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (BELOW 5% threshold - first batch)
CSV Updates: No new data added - metadata.csv (12 sources), cholera_data.csv (15 observations)
Coverage Status: First batch below threshold, minimum 2 batches required before stopping

Key Institutional Insights:
1. Academic repositories lack Chad-specific cholera research digitization
2. Grey literature portals (OpenGrey) discontinued or lack Chad content
3. Institut Pasteur research focuses on regional Lake Chad Basin patterns rather than country-specific data
4. Most bilateral cooperation documentation is programmatic rather than epidemiological
5. Military/peacekeeping sources reference current refugee crisis but not historical cholera outbreaks

=== BATCH 2/20 EXECUTION - START TIME: 22:50:30 ===

Query Results Summary:
- 0 of 20 queries resulted in NEW cholera_data.csv additions
- Key findings: DHS surveys (2004, 2014) included cholera but microdata no longer accessible; Lake Chad Basin research confirms endemic patterns but lacks new quantitative data; cross-border surveillance networks documented but no specific Chad outbreak numbers; African Development Bank PAEPA program eliminated cholera at KÃ©lo hospital but no case data; World Bank health system strengthening project documents lack epidemiological data; CEMAC regional networks provide coordination framework but no specific surveillance data; private sector oil pipeline health assessments reference diseases generally but no cholera outbreak specifics; ethnobotanical research extensive in Chad but no cholera treatment quantification; climate change adaptation reports document vulnerability but no outbreak data; current 2025 preparedness efforts document threat but no historical case numbers
- Search coverage: Demographic health surveys, water quality monitoring, cross-border surveillance, community health assessments, development programs, technical project reports, regional health networks, private sector health assessments, academic research, environmental impact assessments, refugee health assessments, laboratory surveillance networks, health facility surveys, outbreak investigations, traditional medicine, seasonal migration patterns, market surveillance, educational institutions, climate adaptation, urban planning
- Validation challenges: Most sources provided institutional frameworks, policy documentation, or regional context rather than specific quantitative Chad cholera outbreak data
- Key institutions: USAID DHS program, African Development Bank, World Bank, CEMAC, Africa CDC, Institut Pasteur, WHO AFRO, various NGOs and humanitarian organizations

=== BATCH 2 COMPLETION - TIME: 22:55:00 ===
Data Observation Yield: 0/20 = 0% (BELOW 5% threshold - second consecutive batch)
CSV Updates: No new data added - metadata.csv (12 sources), cholera_data.csv (15 observations)
Coverage Status: STOPPING CRITERIA MET - 2 consecutive batches below 5% threshold

Key Systematic Coverage Insights:
1. DHS program included cholera indicators but raw data access restricted due to funding cuts
2. Lake Chad Basin research focuses on regional genomic analysis rather than country-specific quantification
3. Development bank programs measure health outcomes through infrastructure metrics rather than disease surveillance
4. Most institutional frameworks provide coordination and policy guidance rather than epidemiological data
5. Current humanitarian focus on 2025 cholera preparedness rather than historical data documentation

=== AGENT 4 COMPLETION STATUS ===
COMPLETED: Agent 4 obscure source expansion
Total Batches: 2 (minimum requirement met)
Total Queries: 40 (minimum requirement met)
Data Observation Yields: 0%, 0% (stopping criteria satisfied)
Final Coverage Results: Comprehensive institutional and specialized source coverage but no new quantitative cholera data discovered
Agent 4 Status: SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED - proceeding to Agent 5
