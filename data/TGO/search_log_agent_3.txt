- 1973-1995: 22-year gap - REQUIRES VALIDATION
- 1996-2010: National surveillance data (covered)
- 2011-2012: 2-year gap - REQUIRES VALIDATION  
- 2013: Multi-regional outbreak (covered)
- 2014-2019: 5-year gap - REQUIRES VALIDATION
- 2020: Maritime/Lomé outbreak (covered)
- 2021: Lacs district outbreak (covered)
- 2022-2024: 2-year gap - REQUIRES VALIDATION
- 2025: Current outbreak (covered)

TARGET VALIDATION PERIODS:
1. 1973-1995: Post-El Tor cholera-free period validation
2. 2011-2012: Inter-outbreak gap validation
3. 2014-2019: Extended cholera-free period validation 
4. 2022-2024: Recent gap validation

VALIDATION OBJECTIVES:

KEY FINDINGS BATCH 1:
- 1973-1995 Period: SURVEILLANCE GAP, not validated absence (no national surveillance until 1996)
- 1980s-1990s: Surveillance system non-functional, apparent absence due to lack of detection capacity
- 2011-2012: Limited evidence, inter-outbreak period documentation sparse
- 2014-2019: Potential absence 2017-2019 after 2016 outbreak, needs validation
- 2022-2024: Mixed - December 2023 outbreak, 2024 zero cases reported
- Critical Discovery: Most apparent "absence periods" are surveillance system gaps, not true cholera-free periods
- WHO Framework: Zero reporting encouraged but "absence of reporting ≠ reported absence"

VALIDATION ASSESSMENT:
- 1973-1995: INVALID - surveillance system gap, not cholera-free period
- 2011-2012: INCONCLUSIVE - insufficient validation evidence
- 2014-2019: POTENTIAL - 2017-2019 period may be valid absence requiring more validation
- 2022-2024: INVALID - December 2023 outbreak breaks period

DATA OBSERVATIONS ADDED TO CSV: 0 new rows (validation revealed surveillance gaps, not absence periods)

KEY FINDINGS BATCH 2:
- 2017-2019 Period: NO EVIDENCE of validated absence or zero transmission confirmation
- WHO Zero Reporting: Framework exists but no Togo-specific validation found for 2017-2019
- Literature Review: "Cases of cholera occur every year" in countries like Togo with "relatively low incidence"
- Regional Context: West African surveillance gaps documented, 54% average coverage with substantial gaps
- Cross-Border Context: Active cross-border surveillance initiatives but no absence validation
- Academic Literature: No studies specifically validating absence periods for 2017-2019
- Surveillance System: Functional but no formal "zero transmission validation" protocols found
- Critical Finding: Most searches suggest ongoing low-level transmission rather than validated absence

VALIDATION CONCLUSION:
- NO VALIDATED ZERO-TRANSMISSION PERIODS IDENTIFIED for any target periods
- 1973-1995: Surveillance system gap (non-functional)
- 2011-2012: Enhanced surveillance but no absence validation
- 2014-2019: Potential lower incidence but no validated absence
- 2017-2019: No evidence of zero transmission validation
- 2022-2024: Mixed with December 2023 outbreak

CRITICAL INSIGHT: Apparent "absence periods" are surveillance system limitations, not true cholera-free periods requiring zero-transmission documentation
