=== AGENT 3 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Tanzania (TZA)
Agent: 3 (Zero-transmission validation & systematic absence documentation)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 09:45:00
Status: INITIALIZED

=== ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION PROTOCOL ===
Focus: Systematic validation and documentation of cholera-free periods
Coverage Target: All validated absence periods 2000-2024
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries) before stopping criteria apply
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Priority: Gap periods 2019-2023, historical validation, COVID-19 impact assessment

=== CURRENT ZERO-TRANSMISSION DATA FROM AGENTS 1-2 ===
Agent 1: 2019-2021 zero-transmission periods documented
Agent 2: Zanzibar 2017-2023 cholera elimination validated
Gap Analysis: Additional absence periods requiring validation

=== ZERO-TRANSMISSION SEARCH STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: Gap period validation (2000-2009, 2018, 2022)
Phase 2: COVID-19 prevention impact assessment
Phase 3: Surveillance system documentation of absence periods
Phase 4: Cross-validation with regional patterns

=== MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION ===
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All validated cholera-free periods MUST be documented as data observations in cholera_data.csv
Format: Location AFR::TZA, TL/TR period dates, deaths=0, sCh=0, CFR=0.0, validated absence
Evidence: WHO surveillance confirmation, academic validation, government reports
