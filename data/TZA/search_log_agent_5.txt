=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Tanzania (TZA)
Agent: 5 (Source permutation & adjacent data mining)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 10:05:00
Status: INITIALIZED

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION PROTOCOL ===
Focus: Source permutation & adjacent data mining - alternative search terms, adjacent topics, query variations
Coverage Target: Permutations of successful search terms, adjacent health topics, alternative terminology
Minimum: 2 batches (40 queries) before stopping criteria apply
Stopping: 2 consecutive batches <5% data observation yield
Priority: Permute successful queries from Agents 1-4, explore adjacent waterborne diseases, alternative geographic/institutional terms

=== CURRENT DATA STATUS FROM AGENTS 1-4 ===
Agent 1: 12 data observations, 5 sources (baseline establishment)
Agent 2: 6 data observations, 3 sources (geographic expansion) 
Agent 3: 1 data observation, 0 new sources (zero-transmission validation)
Agent 4: 0 data observations, 0 new sources (obscure source expansion)
Total: 19 data observations, 8 sources spanning 2007-2024

=== SOURCE PERMUTATION STRATEGY ===
Phase 1: Permute successful search terms from high-yield Agent 1 and Agent 2 searches
Phase 2: Adjacent waterborne disease mining (diarrheal diseases, acute watery diarrhea, gastroenteritis)
Phase 3: Alternative geographic terminology and institutional name variations
Phase 4: Temporal permutations and alternative date range expressions
Phase 5: Linguistic variations and synonym exploration
Phase 6: Adjacent public health topic mining (WASH, sanitation, water quality)

=== SUCCESSFUL QUERY PATTERNS TO PERMUTE ===
From Agent 1 high-yield queries:
- "Tanzania cholera outbreak 2022-2024" variants
- "Tanzania cholera surveillance WHO" permutations  
- "Tanzania cholera Zanzibar elimination" variations
- "Tanzania cholera regional breakdown" alternatives

From Agent 2 geographic successes:
- "Tanzania Tanga cholera district breakdown" variants
- "Tanzania Zanzibar cholera-free" permutations
- "Tanzania regional cholera deaths" alternatives

=== ADJACENT TOPIC MINING TARGETS ===
Adjacent diseases: Acute watery diarrhea, gastroenteritis, dysentery, typhoid, water-related diseases
Alternative institutions: Ministry of Health variants, WHO AFRO alternatives, regional health bodies
Geographic alternatives: United Republic of Tanzania, Tanzania Mainland, East Africa regional
Temporal alternatives: Recent years, current outbreaks, latest reports, ongoing surveillance
