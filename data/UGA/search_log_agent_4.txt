=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Uganda (UGA)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 15:30:00
Agent 4 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 4: OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ===
Objective: Explore obscure, specialized, and hard-to-find sources for cholera data
Focus Areas: Historical archives, specialized databases, local repositories, unpublished reports
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for baseline systematic coverage
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Obscure Source Strategy: Target sources not covered in mainstream academic/WHO searches

Building on Previous Agent Results:
- Agent 1: 20 data observations, 20 sources (Level 1 reliability)
- Agent 2: +2 data observations, +1 source (22 total observations, 21 sources)
- Agent 3: 0 zero-transmission observations (Uganda continuous transmission since 1997-2000)
- Current Dataset: 22 observations, 21 sources, 100% Level 1 reliability
- Ready for obscure source expansion and specialized archive exploration

Priority Targets for Obscure Source Expansion:
1. Historical Archives: Colonial records, missionary reports, pre-1971 documentation
2. Specialized Databases: Regional health networks, surveillance archives, unpublished reports
3. Local Repositories: District health records, university theses, conference abstracts
4. Alternative Languages: Luganda, Swahili, French sources from regional organizations
5. Unpublished Reports: Government internal documents, consultant reports, NGO archives
6. Technical Sources: Laboratory records, environmental health studies, water quality reports

MANDATORY OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION PROTOCOL:
- Focus on sources NOT covered in mainstream academic searches
- Target historical and archival materials pre-2000
- Explore specialized regional databases and repositories
- Search alternative language sources and local documentation
- Investigate unpublished reports and grey literature

=== BATCH 1 - OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ===
Time: 2025-07-25 15:30:00
Focus: Historical archives + specialized databases + unpublished reports

BATCH 1 SEARCHES COMPLETED (20 queries):
[Obscure source expansion searches targeting historical archives and specialized repositories completed]

KEY FINDINGS FOR OBSCURE SOURCES:
- Historical colonial records: British archives (1903-1961) exist but cholera first reported 1971 (post-independence)
- Missionary records: Church hospitals and mission archives mentioned but specific 1970s-1980s cholera documentation limited
- University repositories: Makerere IR and dissertation archives exist but specific cholera theses not readily discoverable
- Regional networks: EAIDSNet, WHO AFRO, Africa CDC extensive data but mostly published academic studies
- Alternative languages: Luganda (Bukedde newspaper), Swahili, French sources exist but specific cholera coverage not found
- NGO archives: MSF and consultant reports mentioned but evaluation materials largely unpublished/inaccessible
- Laboratory archives: CPHL, NMRL with extensive genomic data but published in scientific journals
- Environmental studies: Comprehensive water quality and contamination reports but published research
- Technical reports: GTFCC, engineering assessments, and IDSR documentation but formal published reports
- Grey literature: Repository systems exist (Mak IR, WHO IRIS) but specific unpublished cholera documents limited

CHALLENGES FOR OBSCURE SOURCE ACCESS:
- Colonial period archives end 1961, cholera began 1971 (chronological gap)
- NGO evaluation materials "largely unpublished" but organizationally inaccessible
- University thesis systems exist but specific cholera research not surface-discoverable
- Military health records no clear public access system identified
- Local newspaper archives require direct institutional access
- Vernacular language sources exist but cholera-specific coverage not documented

OBSCURE SOURCE DATA EXTRACTION:
No quantitative cholera data meeting criteria for cholera_data.csv inclusion found

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD:
- cholera_data.csv updated: 0 new observations added
- Obscure sources discovered: Multiple repository systems identified
- Queries resulting in CSV additions: 0 out of 20 queries
- Data observation yield: 0% (below 5% threshold)
- Status: Need minimum 2 batches before stopping criteria analysis

=== BATCH 2 - OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION ===
Time: 2025-07-25 15:45:00
Focus: Alternative archive approaches + historical pre-1971 documentation + specialized technical databases

BATCH 2 SEARCHES COMPLETED (20 queries):
[Obscure source expansion searches targeting alternative archives and specialized databases completed]

KEY FINDINGS FOR ALTERNATIVE ARCHIVES:
- Internet Archive: General Wayback Machine information but no specific Uganda cholera historical snapshots discoverable
- Archaeological evidence: No pre-1971 cholera evidence (cholera began 1971 with 7th pandemic spread to Africa)
- Oral history: Limited traditional accounts documentation, mostly modern epidemiological studies
- Trading routes: Strong Lake Victoria and cross-border transmission documentation but published research
- Anthropological: Some cultural approaches but limited traditional knowledge specific to Uganda
- Meteorological/Hydrological: Climate-cholera correlations documented but published academic studies
- WHO IRIS: Repository access issues, early 1970s surveillance reports not readily discoverable
- CDC archives: Mainly published research documentation, no specialized backup systems found
- Diplomatic records: No specific cables found (likely classified or restricted access)
- Development archives: World Bank/USAID/UN mostly published reports and general program information
- Media archives: Limited TV/radio/photographic specific cholera historical documentation
- Cartographic/demographic: Published research with maps and analysis but not specialized archives
- Economic/transportation: Well-documented impact studies but primarily published academic sources

CHALLENGES FOR ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ACCESS:
- Historical archives end at independence/colonial period, cholera post-dates this
- Academic repositories contain published studies rather than unpublished archives
- Government and NGO internal archives not publicly accessible through web searches
- Media archives require direct institutional access rather than general web discovery
- Specialized technical databases mostly contain published rather than raw archival data
- International organization archives show published reports rather than internal documents

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE DATA EXTRACTION:
No quantitative cholera data meeting criteria for cholera_data.csv inclusion found

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD:
- cholera_data.csv updated: 0 new observations added
- Alternative archives explored: Comprehensive alternative source categories covered
- Queries resulting in CSV additions: 0 out of 20 queries
- Data observation yield: 0% (below 5% threshold)
- Status: Stopping criteria met (2 consecutive batches <5%)

STOPPING CRITERIA ANALYSIS:
- Batch 1 yield: 0% (below 5%)
- Batch 2 yield: 0% (below 5%)
- Consecutive batches <5%: YES (2 consecutive batches)
- Minimum 2 batches completed: YES (40 queries total)
- STOPPING CRITERIA MET: Agent 4 obscure source expansion complete

=== AGENT 4 COMPLETION SUMMARY ===
