=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Uganda (UGA)
Start Time: 2025-07-25 16:00:00
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION ===
Objective: Execute alternative query formulations and source permutations to discover missed data
Focus Areas: Query variations, alternative terminologies, missed search angles, source recombinations
Minimum Coverage: 2 batches (40 queries) for baseline systematic coverage
Stopping Criteria: Stop when 2 consecutive batches achieve <5% data observation yield
Maximum Queries: 240 queries (12 batches) - highest limit among all agents
Source Permutation Strategy: Systematically vary search approaches, terminologies, and source combinations

Building on Previous Agent Results:
- Agent 1: 20 data observations, 20 sources (Level 1 reliability baseline)
- Agent 2: +2 data observations, +1 source (22 total observations, 21 sources)
- Agent 3: 0 zero-transmission observations (continuous transmission since 1997-2000)
- Agent 4: 0 obscure source observations (archives mostly published or inaccessible)
- Current Dataset: 22 observations, 21 sources, 100% Level 1 reliability
- Ready for comprehensive source permutation and alternative query approaches

Priority Targets for Source Permutation:
1. Alternative Terminologies: Diarrhea, gastroenteritis, acute watery diarrhea, dysentery variations
2. Institutional Variations: Different organizational naming conventions and report types
3. Geographic Permutations: Alternative location names, administrative boundary changes
4. Temporal Variations: Different date formats, seasonal references, calendar systems
5. Language Variants: Alternative English spellings, technical vs colloquial terms
6. Database Permutations: Same sources with different access paths or search interfaces
7. Query Restructuring: Inverse searches, negative space exploration, combination approaches

MANDATORY SOURCE PERMUTATION PROTOCOL:
- Systematically vary query formulations while maintaining core cholera + Uganda focus
- Explore alternative spellings, synonyms, and technical terminology variants
- Target missed search angles from previous agent gaps
- Recombine successful search elements in new permutations
- Apply advanced search operators and alternative database interfaces

=== BATCH 1 - SOURCE PERMUTATION ===
Time: 2025-07-25 16:00:00
Focus: Alternative terminology variations + query reformulations

BATCH 1 SEARCHES COMPLETED (20 queries):
[Source permutation searches targeting alternative terminologies and query variations completed]

KEY FINDINGS FOR SOURCE PERMUTATION:
- Alternative disease terms: Acute watery diarrhea, gastroenteritis, dysentery searches return similar published studies
- IDSR system documentation: Comprehensive surveillance system documentation but published academic research
- Laboratory methods: Vibrio cholerae isolation and confirmation methods well-documented but published protocols
- Treatment approaches: ORT, case management, treatment centers documented but published guidelines
- WASH terminology: Water-sanitation-hygiene related disease searches return published environmental studies  
- Cross-border searches: Regional transmission and surveillance documented but published academic literature
- Seasonal patterns: Rainy season correlations documented but published climate-disease studies
- MOH resources: Weekly Epidemiological Bulletins identified but contemporary publications not historical data
- Public health emergency: Response protocols documented but published operational guidelines
- Refugee surveillance: Camp/settlement outbreaks documented but published epidemiological studies

PERMUTATION SEARCH CHALLENGES:
- Alternative terminologies return similar source sets as primary cholera searches
- Disease surveillance vocabulary leads to same published academic databases
- Technical terms and institutional variations access same source repositories
- Query reformulations discover published studies rather than unpublished quantitative data
- All permutation approaches return peer-reviewed literature rather than novel data sources
- Contemporary surveillance bulletins available but not historical cholera-specific data

SOURCE PERMUTATION DATA EXTRACTION:
No quantitative cholera data meeting criteria for cholera_data.csv inclusion found

BATCH 1 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD:
- cholera_data.csv updated: 0 new observations added
- Alternative terminology sources: Comprehensive published literature discovered
- Queries resulting in CSV additions: 0 out of 20 queries
- Data observation yield: 0% (below 5% threshold)
- Status: Need minimum 2 batches before stopping criteria analysis

=== BATCH 2 - SOURCE PERMUTATION ===
Time: 2025-07-25 16:15:00
Focus: Database interface variations + advanced search operators + missed combination approaches

BATCH 2 SEARCHES COMPLETED (20 queries):
[Source permutation searches targeting database interfaces and advanced search operators completed]

KEY FINDINGS FOR DATABASE INTERFACE VARIATIONS:
- WHO database interfaces: Advanced search features identified but return similar published content as primary searches
- PubMed alternative access: File-type and site-specific operators limited effectiveness via web search interface
- ReliefWeb situation reports: Historical Uganda cholera sitreps found but mostly already covered content
- Uganda MOH epidemiological bulletins: Weekly surveillance system documented but contemporary rather than historical data
- UNIPH database systems: Comprehensive cholera research and surveillance documented but published academic content
- Emergency operations centers: Well-documented response protocols but operational rather than quantitative data
- Africa CDC surveillance: Regional surveillance data available but Uganda specifics already covered
- Cross-border transmission databases: Methodology and policy documentation but limited new quantitative data
- Academic database alternatives: Semantic Scholar, ResearchGate alternatives comprehensive but same published literature
- Global Health Observatory: Database interface documented but no direct access to novel Uganda cholera data

DATABASE INTERFACE SEARCH CHALLENGES:
- Advanced search operators limited effectiveness through general web search interfaces
- Database systems return published academic literature rather than unpublished quantitative data
- Contemporary surveillance bulletins available but focus on current rather than historical periods
- Cross-border surveillance well-documented but primarily policy/methodology rather than specific data
- Alternative academic databases comprehensive but access same published source repositories
- Government database systems documented but specific cholera data mostly published rather than archival

SOURCE PERMUTATION DATA EXTRACTION:
No quantitative cholera data meeting criteria for cholera_data.csv inclusion found

BATCH 2 DATA OBSERVATION YIELD:
- cholera_data.csv updated: 0 new observations added
- Database interface variations explored: Comprehensive alternative access methods covered
- Queries resulting in CSV additions: 0 out of 20 queries  
- Data observation yield: 0% (below 5% threshold)
- Status: Stopping criteria met (2 consecutive batches <5%)

STOPPING CRITERIA ANALYSIS:
- Batch 1 yield: 0% (below 5%)
- Batch 2 yield: 0% (below 5%)
- Consecutive batches <5%: YES (2 consecutive batches)
- Minimum 2 batches completed: YES (40 queries total)
- STOPPING CRITERIA MET: Agent 5 source permutation complete
