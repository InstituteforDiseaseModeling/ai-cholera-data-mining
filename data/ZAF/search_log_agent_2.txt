=== AGENT 2 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: South Africa (ZAF)
Start Time: 2025-08-01 20:11:00

=== AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION AND PROVINCIAL-LEVEL DATA MINING ===
Objective: Execute provincial-level searches with enhanced geographic granularity
Gap Analysis: Agent 1 established 13 observations across multiple time periods - need provincial breakdowns

2. KwaZulu-Natal (2000-2001 major outbreak, provincial focus needed)
3. Limpopo (border region, cross-border transmission, 2024 cases)
4. Free State (2023 cases, need detailed breakdown)
5. Mpumalanga (2003 cases, 2008-2009 cross-border)
6. North West (2023 cases documented)
7. Eastern Cape (historical surveillance needs)
8. Western Cape (potential unreported surveillance)
9. Northern Cape (border surveillance needs)
