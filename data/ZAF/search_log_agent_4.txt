=== AGENT 4 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: South Africa (ZAF)
Start Time: 2025-08-01 20:36:00

=== AGENT 4: OBSCURE SOURCE EXPANSION BEYOND SUGGESTED DOMAINS ===
Objective: Discover cholera data from non-standard sources beyond suggested priority domains
Gap Analysis: Agents 1-3 established 21 sources from standard domains - need obscure/alternative sources
Obscure Source Priority: Social media health reports, local government bulletins, thesis repositories, conference proceedings, regional networks
Stopping Criteria: minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% yield

OBSCURE SOURCE CATEGORIES TARGET LIST:
1. Academic repositories (dissertations, theses, conference abstracts)
2. Social media health reports (verified health department social accounts)
3. Local government websites (municipal health departments, provincial bulletins)
4. Regional health networks (SADC health, Southern African health councils)
5. Non-governmental health organizations (local NGOs, community health groups)
6. Professional medical associations (South African medical societies, public health associations)
7. News archives and local media (provincial newspapers, health beat journalists)
8. Research institution reports (university health departments, epidemiology centers)

BATCH 1/20 QUERIES - ACADEMIC AND THESIS REPOSITORIES
Starting Time: 2025-08-01 20:36:30
Target: University repositories, dissertations, conference proceedings, research databases beyond mainstream academic sources

BATCH 1 RESULTS:
- 20 parallel queries executed targeting academic and thesis repositories, conference proceedings, research databases
- DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
- NEW SOURCES DISCOVERED: 0 (extensive academic infrastructure documented but no new quantitative cholera data sources)
- NEW DATA OBSERVATIONS: 0 (valuable research context gathered but no extractable case/death data)
- SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: University thesis repositories mapped, SAMRC research programs identified, SADC regional reports documented
- No updates to metadata.csv or cholera_data.csv (no quantitative cholera data discovered)
- Completion Time: 2025-08-01 20:41:45

BATCH 2/20 QUERIES - SOCIAL MEDIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOURCES
Starting Time: 2025-08-01 20:41:50
Target: Social media health reports, local government bulletins, municipal health departments, community health notifications

BATCH 2 RESULTS:
- 20 parallel queries executed targeting social media health reports, local government bulletins, municipal health departments, community health notifications
- DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
- NEW SOURCES DISCOVERED: 0 (extensive surveillance system infrastructure documented but no new quantitative cholera data sources)
- NEW DATA OBSERVATIONS: 0 (valuable government response information gathered but no extractable case/death data)
- SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Gauteng Health social media protocols, provincial surveillance systems, municipal health notification processes, community health worker systems
- No updates to metadata.csv or cholera_data.csv (no quantitative cholera data discovered)
- Completion Time: 2025-08-02 07:25:00
