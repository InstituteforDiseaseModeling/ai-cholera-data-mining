=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: South Africa (ZAF)
Start Time: 2025-08-02 07:25:10

=== AGENT 5: SOURCE PERMUTATION AND ADJACENT DATA MINING ===
Objective: Discover cholera data through source permutations and adjacent/related data mining
Gap Analysis: Agents 1-4 established 17 sources - need alternative access points and related data
Source Permutation Priority: Alternative URLs from existing organizations, different document versions, regional reports mentioning South Africa
Stopping Criteria: minimum 2 batches (40 queries), stop when 2 consecutive batches <5% yield

SOURCE PERMUTATION CATEGORIES TARGET LIST:
1. Alternative URLs from established sources (WHO AFRO alternative access, NICD different reports)
2. Regional reports mentioning South Africa (SADC health reports, neighboring country surveillance mentioning SA)
3. Different document versions/formats (PDF vs HTML versions, updated reports, archived versions)
4. Institutional report variations (same organizations but different publication series)
5. Cross-border surveillance reports (Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana reports mentioning SA cases)
6. Regional health network reports (SADC health, Southern African health initiatives)
7. Adjacent temporal data (reports covering periods adjacent to our existing data)
8. Alternative publication formats (newsletters vs reports, bulletins vs situation updates)

BATCH 1/20 QUERIES - ALTERNATIVE URLS AND REGIONAL REPORTS
Starting Time: 2025-08-02 07:25:30
Target: Alternative URLs from existing sources, regional reports mentioning South Africa cholera cases

BATCH 1 RESULTS:
- 20 parallel queries executed targeting alternative URLs from existing sources, regional reports mentioning South Africa cholera cases
- DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
- NEW SOURCES DISCOVERED: 0 (extensive alternative surveillance infrastructure documented but no new quantitative cholera data sources)
- NEW DATA OBSERVATIONS: 0 (valuable source permutation information gathered but no extractable case/death data)
- SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: WHO AFRO weekly bulletins, NICD alternative publications, SADC regional coordination, cross-border surveillance systems, ProMED-mail archives
- No updates to metadata.csv or cholera_data.csv (no quantitative cholera data discovered)
- Completion Time: 2025-08-02 07:30:00

BATCH 2/20 QUERIES - INSTITUTIONAL REPORT VARIATIONS AND TEMPORAL ADJACENCY  
Starting Time: 2025-08-02 07:30:05
Target: Same organizations but different publication series, reports covering periods adjacent to existing data

BATCH 2 RESULTS:
- 20 parallel queries executed targeting institutional report variations and temporal adjacency sources
- DATA OBSERVATION YIELD: 0/20 = 0% (below 5% threshold)
- NEW SOURCES DISCOVERED: 0 (extensive alternative publication infrastructure documented but no new quantitative cholera data sources)
- NEW DATA OBSERVATIONS: 0 (valuable institutional report variation information gathered but no extractable case/death data)
- SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: NICD alternative publication series, WHO temporal adjacent surveillance, academic journal temporal coverage, NHLS surveillance reports, adjacent period research
- No updates to metadata.csv or cholera_data.csv (no quantitative cholera data discovered)
- Completion Time: 2025-08-02 07:35:00

=== AGENT 5 COMPLETION SUMMARY ===
- Total Batches Executed: 2 batches (40 queries)
- Stopping Criteria Met: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (Batch 1: 0%, Batch 2: 0%)
- Total Sources Added: 0 (no new sources added to metadata.csv)
- Total Data Observations Added: 0 (no new data added to cholera_data.csv)
- Source Permutation Categories Explored: Alternative URLs, regional reports, institutional report variations, temporal adjacency sources
- Key Achievements: Comprehensive mapping of alternative surveillance publication formats, documentation of temporal coverage gaps and adjacent period research
- Agent 5 Status: COMPLETED
- End Time: 2025-08-02 07:35:05
