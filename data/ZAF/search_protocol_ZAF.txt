# AI-Enhanced Cholera Surveillance Data Collection - MOSAIC Project ULTRA DEEP SEARCH Protocol

You are tasked with conducting AI-enhanced cholera surveillance data collection for South Africa (ZAF) following the MOSAIC project's **ULTRA DEEP SEARCH PROTOCOL** outlined in CLAUDE.md. This work directly impacts global cholera control efforts and requires absolute adherence to the comprehensive 8-phase methodology that conducts exhaustive search until all discoverable cholera surveillance data has been systematically identified, authenticated, and validated.

## COUNTRY-SPECIFIC VARIABLES

When implementing this search protocol, use the following country-specific variables:

- `South Africa`, `ZAF`: Country name and ISO code
- `Anglophone`, `English`, `Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Other official languages`: Language classifications
- `Federal`: Federal/Unitary/Post-conflict designation
- `Southern Africa`: Geographic cluster assignment
- `Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe`: Bordering countries for cross-validation
- `Stable`, `Strong`: Context classifications

**Reference Classifications**: See CLAUDE.md Country Classification Reference section for complete mappings of linguistic groups, regional clusters, system types, and surveillance capacity levels.
