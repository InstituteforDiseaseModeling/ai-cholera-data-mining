[07:05:20] NEW data observations added: 3 (all zero-transmission validations)
[07:05:20] NEW sources added: 1
[07:05:20] Data observation yield: 15% (3/20 queries)
[07:05:20] Zero-transmission periods validated: 1984-1988 (national), 2012-2015 (Lusaka), 2024-07-11 to present (national)
[07:05:20] Yield > 5% threshold - CONTINUING to Batch 2 (Total: 20 queries)

[07:05:25] === AGENT 3 - BATCH 2 STARTING ===
[07:05:25] Target: Additional zero-transmission validation and inter-epidemic periods
[07:05:25] Focus: 1990s gaps, 2000s validation, surveillance system confirmation of absence

[07:35:10] === BATCH 2 COMPLETED ===
[07:35:10] Batch 2 Results: 20 queries executed
[07:35:10] NEW data observations added: 1 (Luapula Province zero-transmission during national outbreak)
[07:35:10] NEW sources added: 0
[07:35:10] Data observation yield: 5% (1/20 queries)
[07:35:10] Yield = 5% threshold - CONTINUING to Batch 3 (Total: 40 queries)

[07:35:15] === AGENT 3 - BATCH 3 STARTING ===
[07:35:15] Target: Final zero-transmission validation attempts
[07:35:15] Focus: Provincial absence during outbreaks, remaining historical gaps, cross-validation

[08:05:40] === BATCH 3 COMPLETED ===
[08:05:40] Batch 3 Results: 20 queries executed
[08:05:40] NEW data observations added: 0
[08:05:40] NEW sources added: 0
[08:05:40] Data observation yield: 0% (0/20 queries)
[08:05:40] Yield < 5% threshold - 2 consecutive batches <5% - STOPPING Agent 3

[08:05:45] === AGENT 3 FINAL SUMMARY ===
