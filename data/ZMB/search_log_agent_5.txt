=== AGENT 5 INITIALIZATION ===
Country: Zambia (ZMB)
Agent: Source Permutation
Start Time: 2025-08-02 09:20:30
Focus: Variations and permutations of successful search terms and sources from previous agents
Stopping Criteria: 2 consecutive batches <5% yield (minimum 2 batches/40 queries) - MAXIMUM 100 queries
Agent 5 Status: INITIALIZED

[09:20:35] === AGENT 5 - BATCH 1 STARTING ===
[09:20:35] Target: Create variations of successful search strategies from previous agents
[09:20:35] Focus: Permute successful sources (WHO AFRO, MOH, district surveillance, academic studies, IOM), vary terminology, time periods, geographic specificity

[09:50:20] === BATCH 1 COMPLETED ===
[09:50:20] Batch 1 Results: 20 queries executed
[09:50:20] NEW data observations added: 0
[09:50:20] NEW sources added: 0
[09:50:20] Data observation yield: 0% (0/20 queries)
[09:50:20] Yield < 5% threshold - CONTINUING to Batch 2 (minimum 2 batches required)

[09:50:25] === AGENT 5 - BATCH 2 STARTING ===
[09:50:25] Target: Additional permutations focusing on alternative approaches and less explored angles
[09:50:25] Focus: Alternative terminology, different time periods, alternative institutions, cross-validation approaches

[10:20:40] === BATCH 2 COMPLETED ===
[10:20:40] Batch 2 Results: 20 queries executed
[10:20:40] NEW data observations added: 0
[10:20:40] NEW sources added: 0
[10:20:40] Data observation yield: 0% (0/20 queries)
[10:20:40] Yield < 5% threshold - 2 consecutive batches <5% - STOPPING Agent 5

[10:20:45] === AGENT 5 FINAL SUMMARY ===
[10:20:45] Total batches: 2 (40 queries)
[10:20:45] Total data observations: 0 (Batches 1-2: 0+0)
[10:20:45] Total sources: 0 (Batches 1-2: 0+0)
[10:20:45] Average yield: 0% (0/40 queries)
[10:20:45] Status: SOURCE PERMUTATION COMPLETE - STOPPING CRITERIA MET
