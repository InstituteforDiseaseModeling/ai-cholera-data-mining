- Ministry reports: Environmental health assessments and situation reports
- Parliament health committee: Mentioned but inquiry reports not accessible online
- Status: INSTITUTIONAL CONTACT REQUIRED - Archives exist but need direct access

**INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS**:
✅ POLICY FOCUS: World Bank and AfDB engagement documented but limited cholera-specific data
- AfDB: $1M grant for 2018 cholera response, $33M WASH infrastructure projects

- Status: GENERAL HEALTH SECTOR - No specific cholera data observations

**RELIGIOUS AND MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS**:
✅ RECENT ACTIVITY: Catholic Church cholera response documented
- Catholic Relief Services: Active in 2023-2024 outbreak response
- Mission hospitals: St. Albert Mission Hospital, Mary Mount Mission Hospital
- Status: CURRENT RESPONSE - Recent activities documented but no historical data

Successful Queries: 0/20 (0% yield - no new data observations added to cholera_data.csv)
Primary Value: Institutional mapping and access pathway identification

STOPPING CRITERIA ASSESSMENT:
- Minimum batches: 2/2 batches required (currently 1/2)
- Current yield: 0% (below 5% threshold)
- Continue to Batch 2: REQUIRED (minimum not met)

=== BATCH 2: SPECIALIZED SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONAL EXPLORATION ===
Time: 2025-08-02 17:27:15
Queries: 20 queries targeting specialized sectors and institutional health surveillance
Strategy: Comprehensive exploration of sector-specific cholera surveillance and health records

KEY FINDINGS FROM BATCH 2:

**SPECIALIZED HEALTH SURVEILLANCE SECTORS**:
✅ COMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL MAPPING: Multiple sectors with health surveillance capabilities identified
- Traditional healers: ZINATHA (Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association) established 1981
