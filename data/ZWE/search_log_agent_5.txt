- ECDC monitoring + transmission dynamics: Seasonal patterns and resistance surveillance documented

**TEMPORAL AND METHODOLOGICAL VARIATIONS**:
✅ SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF HISTORICAL AND TECHNICAL APPROACHES: Alternative approaches comprehensively tested
- Historical "Asiatic cholera" terminology: No colonial period CDC surveillance reports identified
- Oral rehydration therapy case series: PMC studies documented but for known outbreaks (2008-2009, 2018-2019)
- Rapid diagnostic test surveillance: CDC PMC studies but for documented outbreak periods
- Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: Comprehensive data but for known 2018-2019 outbreak
- Community case management statistics: Provincial data but for documented outbreaks

**SPECIALIZED SURVEILLANCE APPROACHES**:
✅ ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE METHODOLOGIES EXPLORED: Multiple surveillance angles systematically investigated
