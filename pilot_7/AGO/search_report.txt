## LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES

### Data Completeness:
1. **Provincial detail gaps**: Some historical outbreaks lack sub-national breakdown
2. **Case definition variations**: Different sources may use varying cholera case criteria  
3. **Laboratory confirmation**: Not all suspected cases have confirmed Vibrio cholerae
4. **Reporting delays**: Historical outbreaks may have underestimated case numbers
5. **Access restrictions**: Some MSF and academic sources behind paywalls

### Source Authentication:
1. **Archive dependency**: Historical sources increasingly dependent on Internet Archive
2. **Language barriers**: Portuguese sources may contain translation uncertainties
3. **Government source reliability**: Political factors may influence official reporting
4. **Time-sensitive links**: Some current outbreak URLs may become archived over time

### Geographic Precision:
1. **Administrative changes**: Province boundaries and names changed over time
2. **Urban/rural distinction**: Limited granularity below provincial level
3. **Cross-border zones**: Exact transmission locations often approximate
4. **Population denominators**: Census data quality varies by time period

### Confidence Weighting:
1. **Single-source data**: Some observations rely on single authoritative source
2. **Historical validation**: Older data harder to cross-verify with contemporary sources
3. **Preliminary reports**: Some 2025 data may be updated as outbreak evolves
4. **Environmental factors**: Climate and WASH data correlation not quantified
