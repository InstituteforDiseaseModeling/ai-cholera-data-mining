# Angola Cholera Data Search Report

## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the results of comprehensive internet searches conducted to identify additional sources of cholera transmission information for Angola that could complement the existing JHU cholera database. The search identified multiple high-quality data sources spanning from 1971 to 2025, with particularly rich datasets for the 2006 major outbreak and current 2025 outbreak.

## Search Methodology
Multiple targeted searches were conducted using various query combinations focusing on:
- WHO situation reports and disease outbreak news
- Academic literature and peer-reviewed papers
- UNICEF humanitarian reports and situation updates
- Ministry of Health surveillance data
- Regional and international cholera surveillance systems

## Key Findings

### 1. WHO Global Health Observatory Database
- Provides annual cholera case numbers for Angola (2006-2016)
- Shows clear outbreak patterns with peak in 2006 (67,257 cases)
- Demonstrates significant year-to-year variation in case numbers
- Complements JHU data by providing standardized annual aggregates

### 2. WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON) Reports
- Extensive documentation of 2006 major outbreak with weekly progression
- Detailed case fatality rates and geographic distribution
- Sub-national data showing provincial attack rates
- Real-time outbreak monitoring data not found in JHU database

### 3. UNICEF Humanitarian Reports
- Specific outbreak data for 2016-2017 and 2018 periods
- Provincial-level case and death counts
- Age demographic breakdowns for affected populations
- Epidemiological studies including 2018 cholera hotspots analysis

### 4. WHO AFRO Regional Surveillance
- Current 2025 outbreak with detailed provincial breakdowns
- Weekly epidemiological bulletins with case progressions
- Cross-border transmission patterns with DRC
- Surveillance system performance metrics

### 5. Academic Literature Sources
- Historical analysis spanning 1992-2006 with molecular epidemiology
- Seasonal pattern analysis for sub-Saharan Africa
- Regional burden studies comparing Angola to other countries
- Detection delay analysis and outbreak response evaluations

## Relationship to JHU Database

### Complementary Data Periods
- **2006-2012**: Extensive WHO data fills gaps in JHU weekly structure
- **2016-2018**: UNICEF provincial data provides sub-national detail
- **2025**: Current outbreak offers real-time validation opportunities

### Geographic Enhancement
- JHU data focuses on national level (AFR::AGO)
- New sources provide provincial and municipal breakdowns
- Cross-border transmission patterns with neighboring countries
- Urban vs rural transmission dynamics

### Temporal Granularity
- JHU has irregular reporting periods (atypical timeframes)
- WHO DON provides weekly progression during outbreaks
- UNICEF reports offer situation updates during active outbreaks
- Academic sources provide long-term historical context

### Data Quality Assessment
- WHO data provides standardized case definitions
- UNICEF data includes field validation and demographic details
- Academic sources offer peer-reviewed analysis and quality control
- Ministry of Health data provides local context and verification

## Data Gaps Identified

### Missing Time Periods
- 2010-2015: Limited surveillance data available
- 2019-2024: Gap between historical outbreaks and current outbreak
- Pre-2006: Limited systematic surveillance data

### Geographic Limitations
- Rural areas often underrepresented in surveillance
- Border regions may have incomplete reporting
- Municipality-level data availability varies by outbreak

### Demographic Details
- Age-specific case rates limited to recent outbreaks
- Gender-disaggregated data not consistently available
- Occupation and socioeconomic status rarely documented

## Recommendations for JHU Database Enhancement

### High Priority Additions
1. WHO DON weekly progression data for 2006 outbreak
2. UNICEF provincial data for 2016-2017 outbreak
3. WHO AFRO current outbreak data for validation
4. Academic literature historical context data

### Medium Priority Additions
1. Ministry of Health surveillance system data
2. Cross-border transmission pattern data
3. Seasonal pattern analysis results
4. Case fatality rate trends by province

### Data Quality Improvements
1. Standardize case definitions across sources
2. Implement geographic coding consistency
3. Add data source reliability ratings
4. Include outbreak detection delay metrics

## Conclusion
The search identified substantial additional cholera surveillance data for Angola that could significantly enhance the JHU database. The most valuable additions would be the detailed 2006 outbreak progression data from WHO DON reports and the provincial-level data from UNICEF reports covering 2016-2018. These sources would provide both temporal granularity during outbreak periods and geographic detail for sub-national analysis.

The complementary nature of these data sources suggests that Angola could serve as an excellent pilot case for demonstrating how multiple surveillance systems can be integrated to provide comprehensive cholera transmission information for epidemiological modeling and public health decision-making.
