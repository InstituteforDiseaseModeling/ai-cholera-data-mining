# AI-Enhanced Cholera Surveillance Data Collection - MOSAIC Project ULTRA DEEP SEARCH Protocol

You are tasked with conducting AI-enhanced cholera surveillance data collection for Angola (AGO) following the MOSAIC project's **ULTRA DEEP SEARCH PROTOCOL** outlined in CLAUDE.md.

- `Unitary`: Federal/Unitary/Post-conflict designation
- `Southern Africa`: Geographic cluster assignment
- `DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia`: Bordering countries for cross-validation
- `Post-conflict`, `Moderate`: Context classifications

**Reference Classifications**: See CLAUDE.md Country Classification Reference section for complete mappings of linguistic groups, regional clusters, system types, and surveillance capacity levels.
