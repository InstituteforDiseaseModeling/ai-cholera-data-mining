- Some provincial breakdowns calculated from percentages (clearly documented)
- 2024 surveillance data gap noted (no cases reported, validated as accurate)

### Resolution Strategies
- Multiple source triangulation for major outbreak periods
- Clear documentation of data extraction methods and assumptions
- Conservative confidence weighting for derived/calculated data points
- Comprehensive cross-referencing with academic literature for validation
