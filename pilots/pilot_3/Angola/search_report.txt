- **Ongoing**: High cross-border risk with DRC and Zambia

## Relationship to JHU Data

This enhanced dataset complements the existing JHU cholera taxonomy database by:

1. **Filling Temporal Gaps**: Providing specific case/death counts for major outbreak years
2. **Provincial Detail**: Adding sub-national geographic resolution
3. **Current Surveillance**: Documenting the ongoing 2025 outbreak in real-time
4. **Cross-validation**: Confirming historical outbreak patterns with multiple sources
5. **Enhanced Metrics**: Providing CFR calculations and demographic breakdowns

### Integration Points:
- National-level annual totals align with JHU yearly summaries
- Provincial data provides downscaling opportunities for modeling
- Current outbreak data enables real-time model calibration
- Historical patterns validate long-term trend analyses

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths:
- **High Source Reliability**: 100% Level 1-2 sources
- **Multi-source Validation**: Major outbreaks confirmed by multiple independent sources
- **Official Documentation**: Primary reliance on WHO and government sources
- **Recent Real-time Data**: Comprehensive 2025 outbreak coverage
- **Cross-border Context**: Regional transmission patterns documented

### Limitations:
- **Missing Intermediate Years**: Limited data for years between major outbreaks
- **Provincial Coverage**: Uneven provincial-level detail across time periods
- **Case Definition Variations**: Different reporting standards across time periods
- **Underreporting Potential**: Likely underascertainment during conflict periods
- **Sub-annual Resolution**: Most data aggregated to annual level

### Uncertainty Quantification:
- **High Certainty (1.0)**: WHO official reports, ECDC surveillance
- **High-Medium Certainty (0.9)**: Peer-reviewed academic literature
- **Medium Certainty (0.8)**: UNICEF humanitarian reports
- **Medium-Low Certainty (0.7)**: Historical estimates from recent sources

## Recommendations for Future Data Collection

### Priority Areas:
1. **Intermediate Years**: Focus on 1988-2005, 2012, 2014-2015, 2018-2024
2. **Provincial Detail**: Seek provincial-level data for all major outbreaks
3. **Sub-annual Resolution**: Monthly/weekly data during outbreak periods
4. **Cross-border Documentation**: More detailed DRC-Angola transmission data
5. **Demographic Breakdowns**: Age/sex-specific data where available

### Search Strategy Improvements:
1. **Portuguese Language Sources**: Direct searches of Angolan government websites
2. **Regional Archives**: African Union, ECOWAS, SADC surveillance archives
3. **Academic Institutions**: Angolan university research publications
4. **NGO Archives**: MSF, IRC, Oxfam field reports from Angola
5. **Historical Newspapers**: Luanda press archives for outbreak reports

### Quality Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to WHO AFRO and Angola Ministry of Health
2. **Academic Collaboration**: Contact authors of key papers for additional data
3. **Regional Networks**: Engage with Africa CDC and regional surveillance systems
4. **Historical Validation**: Cross-reference with neighboring country outbreak data

## Conclusion

This systematic search successfully enhanced Angola's cholera surveillance dataset with 21 high-quality data records spanning over 50 years. The current 2025 outbreak is comprehensively documented, and major historical outbreaks are well-characterized with case/death counts and geographic detail. The enhanced dataset provides strong foundation for epidemiological modeling while clearly documenting uncertainties and data gaps for future collection priorities.

The search demonstrates the value of systematic, multi-tier search strategies for uncovering comprehensive surveillance data, particularly for countries with complex outbreak histories and ongoing public health emergencies.
