## STATISTICAL VALIDATION RESULTS

### Outlier Detection Analysis
**METHODOLOGY**: Modified Z-score for CFR values, IQR analysis for case counts

#### CFR Outlier Analysis
- **Normal range**: 1.3% - 5.0% (75% of data points)
- **Upper outliers**: 9.1-9.8% (3 data points)
- **Assessment**: High CFRs epidemiologically plausible for:
  - 1987 outbreak (post-conflict, limited healthcare)
  - Rural provinces in 2006 (Cuanza Norte, Benguela early phase)

#### Case Count Consistency
- **2006 Outbreak progression**: Exponential growth followed by plateau ✓
