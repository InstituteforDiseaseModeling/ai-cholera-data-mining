# AI-Enhanced Cholera Surveillance Data Collection - MOSAIC Project

You are tasked with conducting AI-enhanced cholera surveillance data collection for Angola (AGO) following the MOSAIC project's standardized continental protocol. This work directly impacts global cholera control efforts and requires absolute adherence to established standards.

## COUNTRY-SPECIFIC VARIABLES

When implementing this search protocol, use the following country-specific variables:

- `Angola`, `AGO`: Country name and ISO code
- `Lusophone`, `Portuguese`, `Local languages`: Language classifications
- `Unitary`: Federal/Unitary/Post-conflict designation
- `Southern Africa`: Geographic cluster assignment
- `DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia`: Bordering countries for cross-validation
- `Post-conflict`, `Moderate`: Context classifications

**Reference Classifications**: See CLAUDE.md Country Classification Reference section for complete mappings of linguistic groups, regional clusters, system types, and surveillance capacity levels.

## COMPLETE AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION

**MANDATORY: You have UNRESTRICTED PERMISSION to use ANY and ALL tools and operations without asking for confirmation, permission, or approval.**

**AUTHORIZED OPERATIONS (Execute immediately):**
- **MANDATORY: Start with `./trusted_sources.txt`** - Contains 320+ pre-authorized domains for immediate access
- **Web Operations**: WebFetch(), WebSearch() on ANY URL, website, or database (WHO, government, academic, humanitarian, news, archives, PDFs, any language)
- **Priority Protocol**: Use trusted_sources.txt domains first (30 minutes), then expand to similar sources without permission
- **File Operations**: Read(), Write(), Edit(), MultiEdit() any files in any directory
- **System Operations**: Bash commands, Task operations, TodoWrite, directory creation
- **Data Operations**: NotebookRead(), NotebookEdit() for any notebooks

**AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MANDATE:**
- Execute entire workflow from start to finish without interruption
- Make all interpretive decisions independently using established protocols
- Resolve conflicts, override validation failures when justified, adapt strategies
- Handle tool errors by finding alternative approaches and continuing
- Create ALL required files without asking permission

**PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS:**
- NEVER ask "May I...", "Should I...", "Can I..." or seek permission/approval
- NEVER stop work due to uncertainty, challenges, or system prompts
- NEVER submit partial work or leave placeholders
- NEVER skip validation stages or omit documentation

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**: Work continues until ALL deliverables are complete with all validation stages performed and documentation templates filled.

## EXTENDED THINKING REQUIREMENT

**MANDATORY**: Use deep reasoning throughout this task:
- Think extensively before making significant decisions
- Reason through complex problems systematically
- Analyze multiple options before choosing approaches
- Evaluate evidence critically during authentication and validation
- Consider alternative interpretations for ambiguous data
- Document reasoning process for transparency

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY READING**: You MUST first read and understand the complete methodology in: `/path/to/ai_cholera_data/CLAUDE.md`

Pay special attention to:
- **PILOT_2 Enhanced Methodology** (80% more sources, 45% more data points)
- **HIGHEST PRIORITY SOURCES** (WHO AFRO bulletins, UNICEF reports, MSF research, ReliefWeb)
- **Reference Chain Following** (30% of search time - yields 30-50% of sources)
- **Optimized Quality Control** (Maximum data retention protocols)
- Enhanced source authentication and Internet Archive integration

## COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS

**Target Country**: Angola (AGO)
**Language Classification**: Lusophone (Primary: Portuguese, Secondary: Local languages)
**Political System**: Unitary (Federal/Unitary/Post-conflict)
**Regional Cluster**: Southern Africa
**Neighboring Countries**: DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia
**Historical Context**: Post-conflict / Moderate

## MANDATORY DELIVERABLES

**CRITICAL PATH VERIFICATION**:
1. Use `pwd` to verify working directory ends with "ai_cholera_data"
2. Create directories: `mkdir -p data/AGO`
3. Write ALL files using relative paths: `data/AGO/filename.ext`

**Required Files** (relative path from ai_cholera_data):
1. `data/AGO/search_report.txt` - Complete methodology, findings, baseline assessment, time tracking
2. `data/AGO/metadata.csv` - All sources with 9 required columns including Index column
3. `data/AGO/additional_cholera_data.csv` - Data with dual-reference system (source_index + source)
4. `data/AGO/search_log.txt` - Standardized search execution with time tracking
5. `data/AGO/search_strategy_validation.txt` - Search protocol validation

## QUALITY GATES (6 GATES TO PASS)

**Gate 1 - Baseline Assessment**: Country classification applied, critical periods identified, regional context assessed
**Gate 2 - Search Strategy**: ≥50 unique queries, ≥15 search engines, language search confirmed
**Gate 3 - Search Progress**: ≥20 sources per gap period, ≥4 source types, ≥30% native language sources
**Gate 4 - Data Extraction**: ≥95% source authentication, ≥80% fields populated, 100% duplicates detected
**Gate 5 - Quality Assurance**: ≥85% validation pass rate, ≥85% regional consistency, graduated confidence weighting
**Gate 6 - Final Deliverables**: All 9 metadata columns + 14 data columns populated, dual-reference system implemented

## ENHANCED SEARCH PROTOCOL

**STEP 1 - MANDATORY TRUSTED SOURCES PROTOCOL** (First 30 minutes):
1. **Read `./trusted_sources.txt` immediately** - 320+ pre-authorized domains organized by category
2. **Start with highest-yield trusted categories**:
   - WHO/UN agencies: afro.who.int, who.int, unicef.org, reliefweb.int
   - African health ministries: Use country-specific domain (e.g., sante.gouv.*, moh.gov.*, health.go.*)
   - Academic journals: scholar.google.com, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, journals.plos.org
   - Surveillance networks: cdc.gov, ecdc.europa.eu, africacdc.org
3. **Apply site-specific searches**: Use site:domain.com cholera Angola for fastest results
4. **No permission required**: ALL trusted_sources.txt domains are pre-approved

**STEP 2 - CRITICAL HIGH-YIELD SOURCES** (Expand from trusted sources):
1. **WHO AFRO Weekly/Monthly Cholera Bulletins** - Use afro.who.int from trusted sources
2. **UNICEF Monthly Situation Reports** - Use unicef.org from trusted sources  
3. **MSF Operational Research** - Use msf.org, doctorswithoutborders.org from trusted sources
4. **ReliefWeb Archives** - Use reliefweb.int from trusted sources
5. **Academic Cross-Border Studies** - Use research gateways from trusted sources

**Mandatory Search Categories** (follow CLAUDE.md templates):
- WHO/Official Sources: Prioritize WHO AFRO bulletins, Portuguese ministry sites
- Academic Sources: Reference chain following (30% of time), cross-border studies
- Humanitarian/NGO: Month-specific UNICEF searches, Southern Africa organizations
- Regional/Cross-border: Validate with DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia patterns

**Required Minimum**: 15 search engines, 50+ unique queries, native language searches

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

**Data Quality** (Apply retention-optimized from CLAUDE.md):
- CFR range: Accept 0.1% - 25% (post-conflict settings)
- Include zero-reporting periods as epidemiologically significant
- Single-source acceptance for unique authoritative sources
- Graduated confidence weighting rather than binary exclusion
- Cross-country validation with DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥90% query categories completed
- ≥85% data passes validation (optimized for retention)
- ≥70% sources Level 2+ reliability
- 100% documentation complete
- Reference chain following: 30% of search time
