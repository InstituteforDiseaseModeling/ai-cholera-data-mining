# AI-Enhanced Cholera Surveillance Data Collection - MOSAIC Project

You are tasked with conducting AI-enhanced cholera surveillance data collection for Angola (AGO) following the MOSAIC project's **COMPREHENSIVE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL**. This work directly impacts global cholera control efforts and requires absolute adherence to the enhanced methodology that conducts exhaustive search until all discoverable cholera surveillance data has been systematically identified and validated.

## COUNTRY-SPECIFIC VARIABLES

When implementing this search protocol, use the following country-specific variables:

- `Angola`, `AGO`: Country name and ISO code
- `Lusophone`, `Portuguese`, `Local languages`: Language classifications
- `Unitary`: Federal/Unitary/Post-conflict designation
- `Southern Africa`: Geographic cluster assignment
- `DRC, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia`: Bordering countries for cross-validation
- `Post-conflict`, `Moderate`: Context classifications

**Reference Classifications**: See CLAUDE.md Country Classification Reference section for complete mappings of linguistic groups, regional clusters, system types, and surveillance capacity levels.

**PHASE 2: Targeted Gap Filling (REQUIRED)**
1. **Identify specific gaps**: Missing years, regions, outbreak periods
2. **Focused searches**: Target identified gaps with specific queries
3. **Cross-reference validation**: Verify gaps aren't due to search limitations
4. **Regional contextualization**: Check neighboring countries for cross-border patterns
5. **Alternative terminology**: Use synonyms, local terms, different spellings

**PHASE 3: Deep Validation (REQUIRED)**
