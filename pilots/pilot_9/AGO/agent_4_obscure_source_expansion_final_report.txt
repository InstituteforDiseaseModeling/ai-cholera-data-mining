# 5-Agent Progressive Search Workflow - Phase 4 Complete
# Date: 2025-07-20

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agent 4 successfully executed comprehensive obscure source expansion for Angola cholera surveillance data enhancement, achieving a 12.5% increase in validated data points (54 vs 48 baseline) and 23.8% increase in authenticated sources (26 vs 21 baseline) through systematic exploration of sources beyond the 349+ suggested domains. The beyond-suggested-sources strategy discovered critical regional coordination documents, alternative media sources, community surveillance reports, and historical archives that provide unique perspectives on Angola's cholera surveillance landscape not captured in conventional search methodologies.

- **5 new authenticated sources** (26 total vs 21 Agent 3 baseline)
- **6 new validated data points** (54 total vs 48 Agent 3 baseline) = 12.5% increase
- **Beyond-suggested-sources focus:** All discoveries from domains NOT in priority_sources.txt
- **Regional coordination enhancement:** SADC/AU leadership documentation
- **Alternative media diversification:** Chinese and African media surveillance data
- **Community surveillance integration:** AllAfrica.com field reporting network
- **Historical depth expansion:** Portuguese colonial medical infrastructure context

**Agent 4 Performance Metrics:**
- **Data Yield:** 12.5% increase (significantly exceeding ≤5% stopping criteria threshold)
- **Source Quality:** 73% Level 1-2 sources (19/26 sources) vs 95% Agent 3 baseline
- **Beyond-Suggested Focus:** 100% of new sources from non-suggested domains
- **Validation Success:** 100% validation pass rate maintained across all new discoveries
- **Discovery Innovation:** Regional archives, alternative media, community sources
