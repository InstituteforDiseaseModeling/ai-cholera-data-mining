# MOSAIC AI CHOLERA DATA COLLECTION - 5-AGENT PROGRESSIVE SEARCH WORKFLOW

## OVERVIEW
**Target Country**: Angola (AGO)

This workflow implements a progressive 5-agent system for maximizing cholera surveillance data discovery while maintaining rigorous quality standards. Each agent builds systematically on previous work with objective decision points and automated termination criteria.

## WORKFLOW CONTROL PARAMETERS

### **Progressive Targets**:
- Agent 1: Baseline establishment (8-phase protocol completion)
- Agent 2: Target 50% data observation increase (geographic expansion)
- Agent 3: Target 25% additional data observation increase (temporal completion)
- Agent 4: Target 12% additional data observation increase (obscure source expansion)
- Agent 5: Target 6% additional data observation increase (saturation confirmation)

### **Quality Gates**:
- **Agents 1-3**: ≥90% Level 1-2 source reliability maintained
- **Agent 4**: ≥85% Level 1-3 source reliability (allows Level 3 with proper weighting)
- **Agent 5**: Any level acceptable with proper confidence_weight assignment
- **All Agents**: 100% validation pass rate achieved
- **All Agents**: Zero-transmission periods preserved as epidemiologically relevant
- **All Agents**: Complete documentation and audit trail

### **Efficiency Controls**:
- Objective stopping criteria prevent over-searching
- Pause-and-review checkpoints enable resource optimization
- Progressive intensity avoids unnecessary early work
- Saturation detection prevents diminishing returns

### **Automation Parameters**:
- Execute all agents sequentially without user prompts
- Log progress metrics after each agent completion
- Report consolidated results only at conclusion
- Maintain quality standards throughout progression
- **Report end-to-end total run time for complete 5-agent workflow**

## AGENT 2: GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION
**Trigger**: Automatically execute after Agent 1 completion
**Objective**: Enhanced data discovery through systematic geographic expansion

**EXPANDED ULTRA DEEP SEARCH PROTOCOL**
Do a more extensive deep search to find more data sources and more data observations. Drill down into each data observation to find subnational reports of cholera transmission.

**Target**: Aim for 50% increase in data observations from Agent 1 baseline (target, not hard requirement)

This expanded search protocol should include the following tasks:

☐ Additional Source Discovery - ProMED, news archives, government databases, academic preprints
☐ Granular Geographic Search - District and municipality level data discovery

- ALL DISTRICTS: Systematic search of every district-level administrative unit for cholera reports
- High-risk districts: Enhanced searches for districts with known cholera transmission history
- Border districts: Cross-border transmission documentation with neighboring countries
- Urban districts: Major cities and densely populated areas systematic coverage
- Rural/remote districts: Focus on districts with poor surveillance coverage

**SYSTEMATIC DISTRICT SEARCH PROTOCOL:**
☐ Complete District Inventory - Compile complete list of ALL district-level administrative units

## AGENT 3: ZERO-TRANSMISSION VALIDATION & SYSTEMATIC ABSENCE DOCUMENTATION
**Trigger**: Automatically execute after Agent 2 completion
**Objective**: Systematic validation of zero-transmission periods with evidence-based confidence levels

**ZERO-TRANSMISSION SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION PROTOCOL**

The results are improved, now please expand your search to increase data yield if possible and investigate any data gaps. Keep time periods where you are confident that no transmission occurred. These are epidemiologically relevant. Do a detailed temporal search for all month-year combinations to check for missed outbreaks or for time periods where it was likely that there was no transmission. Preserve epidemiologically relevant zero-transmission periods

**Target**: Aim for 25% increase in data observations from Agent 2 results (target, not hard requirement). Document and validate ALL apparent zero-transmission periods from Agent 2's year-by-year searches

This ultra-extensive search should include the following tasks:

☐ Ultra-Extensive Temporal Mining - Systematic month-year searches for all missing periods
☐ Deep Archive Excavation - Internet Archive systematic mining for broken/moved sources
☐ Cross-Reference Chain Following - Follow ALL citation chains to maximum depth
☐ Gap Investigation - Analyze and validate remaining data gaps with evidence
☐ Enhanced Quality Validation - Re-validate all sources with expanded criteria

**MANDATORY YEAR-BY-YEAR SYSTEMATIC DRILLING (1970-2025):**
For each year 1970-PRESENT:
☐ Minimum 30 targeted queries per year
☐ Multi-source searching (WHO, Africa CDC, MSF, UNICEF, academic, news, humanitarian)
☐ Cross-reference with neighboring countries
☐ Document search effort and confidence level
☐ Record as ZERO TRANSMISSION if extensive search yields no evidence

**YEAR-SPECIFIC SEARCH PROTOCOL:**
- "{country} cholera {year}" across all search engines
- "{country} cholera outbreak {year}" news archives
- "WHO {country} cholera surveillance {year}"
- "{country} cholera cases deaths {year}" academic
- Cross-border "{neighboring_countries} cholera {year}"

**ENHANCED TEMPORAL GRANULARITY FOR OUTBREAK YEARS:**
For years with evidence of cholera transmission:
☐ Month-by-month systematic drilling to capture outbreak progression
☐ Seasonal pattern documentation (wet season vs dry season transmission)
☐ Outbreak duration and peak timing identification

**ZERO-TRANSMISSION DOCUMENTATION:**
- confidence_weight based on search thoroughness
- validation_status: "SEARCHED_NO_EVIDENCE"
- processing_notes: "Systematic {year} search yielded no transmission evidence"

**MANDATORY ZERO-TRANSMISSION TASKS:**
☐ Systematic Absence Validation - Verify each year showing no transmission evidence
☐ Cross-Border Absence Correlation - Confirm zero-transmission with neighboring countries
☐ Surveillance System Assessment - Evaluate surveillance capacity for each zero-transmission period

☐ Intervention Impact Assessment - Correlate absence with WASH/vaccination interventions
☐ Confidence Level Assignment - Assign evidence-based confidence weights to absence periods
☐ Alternative Evidence Mining - Search for indirect evidence of transmission during "absent" periods

**ZERO-TRANSMISSION CONFIDENCE FRAMEWORK:**
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE (0.9-1.0)**: Extensive search + functioning surveillance + regional absence
- **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (0.7-0.9)**: Good search coverage + some surveillance evidence
- **LOW CONFIDENCE (0.4-0.6)**: Limited search + uncertain surveillance capacity
- **UNCERTAIN (0.1-0.3)**: Minimal search + poor surveillance + regional transmission

**ENHANCED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**

☐ Regional Epidemic Wave Analysis - Position country absence within regional patterns

**Quality Requirements**:
- Must maintain ≥90% Level 1-2 source reliability
- Must achieve 100% validation pass rate
- Complete gap investigation with evidence-based conclusions
- Preserve epidemiologically relevant zero-transmission periods

**Success Criteria**: Achieve discovery saturation (≤5% yield increase) OR maximum 3 iterations reached

**Checkpoint Requirements**:
