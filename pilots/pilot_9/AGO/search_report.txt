- Missing periods: 2007-2010, 2014-2016, 2019-2024
- Opportunity: WHO weekly surveillance bulletins, AFRO regional reports
- Expected yield: Medium (likely low-level transmission documentation)

**2. Sub-Provincial Geographic Detail**  
- Current coverage: 6/18 provinces with detail
- Missing districts: All except Soyo district detailed
- Opportunity: Provincial health department reports, local newspaper coverage
- Expected yield: Medium (outbreak investigation reports)

**3. Portuguese-Language Government Sources**
- Limited success: Angola Ministry of Health website access issues
- Opportunity: Government health bulletins, epidemiological reports
- Expected yield: High (official surveillance data)

**4. Historical Quantification (1970s-1990s)**
- Current: Contextual information only
- Missing: Annual case numbers, provincial breakdowns
- Opportunity: WHO archives, missionary hospital records, colonial medical reports
- Expected yield: Low (limited digitization of historical records)

**5. Cross-Border Detailed Analysis**
- Current: General patterns documented
- Missing: Specific transmission events, synchronized outbreaks
- Opportunity: DRC surveillance reports, border health posts
- Expected yield: Medium (operational challenges accessing DRC data)

### Search Strategy Recommendations for Agent 2

**1. Enhanced Portuguese-Language Strategy**
