Index,Source,URL,Description,Date_Range,Data_Type,Status,Reliability_Level,Validation_Status,Search_Technique,Language_Original,Citation_Depth,Cross_References,Discovery_Method
```

**cholera_data.csv** (Complete Data Collection):
```csv
Index,Location,TL,TR,Primary,Phantom,deaths,sCh,cCh,CFR,reporting_date,source_index,source,confidence_weight,quality_status,extraction_method,processing_notes
```

## CRITICAL CSV FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: To prevent column shifting errors that compromise data integrity:

### 1. **Consistent Missing Value Handling**
- **Empty fields MUST use empty string between commas**: `,,` (correct)
- **NEVER skip commas for missing values**: `,3.9,` (incorrect - creates column shift)
- **All 17 columns MUST be present in every row** regardless of missing values

### 2. **Required CSV Validation Protocol**
**Execute BEFORE finalizing any CSV file:**

```bash
# Verify column count consistency (must be 17 for cholera_data.csv, 14 for metadata.csv)
awk -F, 'NR==1{cols=NF} NF!=cols{print "ERROR - Line " NR ": " NF " fields (expected " cols ")"}' cholera_data.csv
awk -F, 'NR==1{cols=NF} NF!=cols{print "ERROR - Line " NR ": " NF " fields (expected " cols ")"}' metadata.csv

# Check for common formatting errors
grep -n ',,,' cholera_data.csv  # Multiple consecutive commas indicating formatting issues
grep -n '[^,]$' cholera_data.csv | head -5  # Lines ending without comma structure
```

### 3. **Systematic Data Entry Rules**
- **Use exact header templates** - copy/paste to prevent typos
- **Validate each row before adding** - count commas = headers - 1
- **Boolean values**: Use `true`/`false` (lowercase, NOT True/False)
- **Date format**: Strict `YYYY-MM-DD` format only
- **Decimal format**: Use `.` not `,` for decimals (e.g., `3.9` not `3,9`)

### 4. **Quality Control Checkpoints**
**MANDATORY before file completion:**
- [ ] Header row contains exactly 17 fields for cholera_data.csv
- [ ] Header row contains exactly 14 fields for metadata.csv
- [ ] Every data row contains exactly same number of fields as header
- [ ] No trailing commas or spaces at end of lines
- [ ] All empty fields represented by empty strings between commas
- [ ] Boolean fields contain only `true` or `false`
- [ ] Date fields follow `YYYY-MM-DD` format exactly
- [ ] Decimal numbers use dot notation, not comma notation

### 5. **CSV Error Prevention Example**
```csv
# CORRECT - maintains 17 columns with empty fields
1,AFR::AGO,2025-01-01,2025-03-23,true,false,329,8543,,3.9,2025-03-28,1,WHO Disease Outbreak News 2025 Angola,1.0,VALIDATED,Direct extraction,16 of 21 provinces affected

# INCORRECT - missing comma creates column shift (only 16 columns)
1,AFR::AGO,2025-01-01,2025-03-23,true,false,329,8543,3.9,2025-03-28,1,WHO Disease Outbreak News 2025 Angola,1.0,VALIDATED,Direct extraction,16 of 21 provinces affected
```

**CRITICAL**: Column shifting errors corrupt the entire dataset and prevent MOSAIC modeling integration. Systematic validation is mandatory.
